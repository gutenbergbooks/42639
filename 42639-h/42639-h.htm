<h2>I<br /><br />

<i>INTRODUCTORY</i></h2>


<p>To summon from the past and reproduce with any
detail the story of Israel's life in the desert is
now impossible. The outlines alone remain, severe,
careless of almost everything that does not bear
on religion. Neither from Exodus nor from Numbers
can we gather those touches that would enable us to
reconstruct the incidents of a single day as it passed in
the camp or on the march. The tribes move from one
"wilderness" to another. The hardship of the time of
wandering appears unrelieved, for throughout the history
the doings of God, not the achievements or sufferings
of the people, are the great theme. The patriotism
of the Book of Numbers is of a kind that reminds us
continually of the prophecies. Resentment against the
distrustful and rebellious, like that which Amos, Hosea,
and Jeremiah express, is felt in almost every portion
of the narrative. At the same time the difference
between Numbers and the books of the prophets is
wide and striking. Here the style is simple, often
stern, with little emotion, scarcely any rhetoric. The
legislative purpose reacts on the historical, and makes
the spirit of the book severe. Seldom does the writer
allow himself respite from the grave task of presenting
Israel's duties and delinquencies, and exalting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
majesty of God. We are made continually to feel the
burden with which the affairs of the people are charged;
and yet the book is no poem: to excite sympathy or lead
up to a great climax does not come within the design.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so far as a book of incident and statute
can resemble poetry, there is a parallel between
Numbers and a form of literature produced under
other skies, other conditions&mdash;the Greek drama. The
same is true of Exodus and Deuteronomy; but Numbers
will be found especially to bear out the comparison.
The likeness may be traced in the presentation of a
main idea, the relation of various groups of persons
carrying out or opposing that main idea, and the
Puritanism of form and situation. The Book of Numbers
may be called eternal literature more fitly than the
<i>Iliad</i> and <i>Æneid</i> have been called eternal poems; and
the keen ethical strain and high religious thought make
the movement tragical throughout. Moses the leader
is seen with his helpers and opponents, Aaron and
Miriam, Joshua and Hobab, Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram, Balak and Balaam. He is brought into
extremity; he despairs and appeals passionately to
Heaven; in an hour of pride he falls into sin which
brings doom upon him. The people, murmuring,
craving, suffering, are always a vague multitude. The
tent, the cloud, the incense, the wars, the strain of
the wilderness journey, the hope of the land beyond&mdash;all
have a dim solemnity. The occupying thought is
of Jehovah's purpose and the revelation of His character.
Moses is the prophet of this Divine mystery,
stands for it almost alone, urges it upon Israel, is the
means of impressing it by judgments and victories, by
priestly law and ceremony, by the very example of his
own failure in sudden trial. With a graver and bolder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
purpose than any embodied in the dramatic masterpieces
of Greece, the story of Numbers finds its place
not in literature only, but in the development of universal
religion, and breathes that Divine inspiration which
belongs to the Hebrew and to him alone among those
who speak of God and man.</p>

<p>The Divine discipline of human life is an element of
the theme, but in contrast to the Greek dramas the
books of the exodus are not individualistic. Moses is
great, but he is so as the teacher of religion, the servant
of Jehovah, the lawgiver of Israel. Jehovah, His
religion, His law, are above Moses. The personality
of the leader stands clear; yet he is not the hero of
the Book of Numbers. The purpose of the history
leaves him, when he has done his work, to die on
Mount Abarim, and presses on, that Jehovah may be
seen as a man of war, that Israel may be brought to its
inheritance and begin its new career. The voice of
men in the Greek tragedy is, as Mr. Ruskin says, "We
trusted in the gods; we thought that wisdom and
courage would save us. Our wisdom and courage
deceive us to our death." When Moses despairs, that
is not his cry. There is no Fate stronger than God;
and He looks far into the future in the discipline He
appoints to men, to His people Israel. The remote,
the unfulfilled, gleams along the desert. There is a
light from the pillar of fire even when the pestilence
is abroad, and the graves of the lustful are dug, and the
camp is dissolved in tears because Aaron is dead,
because Moses has climbed the last mountain and shall
never again be seen.</p>

<p>In respect of content, one point shows likeness
between the Greek drama and our book&mdash;the vague
conception of death. It is not an extinction of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
but the human being goes on into an existence of
which there is no definite idea. What remains has
no reckoning, no object. The recoil of the Hebrew
is not indeed piteous, and fraught with horror, like
that of the Greek, although death is the last punishment
of men who transgress. For Aaron and Moses,
and all who have served their generation, it is a high
and venerated Power that claims them when the hour
of departure comes. The God they have obeyed in
life calls them, and they are gathered to their people.
No note of despair is heard like that in the <i>Iphigenia
in Aulis</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"He raves who prays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die. 'Tis better to live on in woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to die nobly."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dying as well as living men are with God; and this
God is the Lord of all. Immense is the difference
between the Greek who trusts or dreads many powers
above, beneath, and the Hebrew realising himself,
however dimly, as the servant of Jehovah the holy,
the eternal. This great idea, seized by Moses, introduced
by him into the faith of his people, remained
it may be indefinite, yet always present to the thought
of Israel with many implications till the time of full
revelation came with Christ, and He said: "Now that
the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the bush,
when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For He is not
the God of the dead, but of the living." The wide
interval between a people whose religion contained this
thought, in whose history it is interwoven, and a people
whose religion was polytheistic and natural is seen in
the whole strain of their literature and life. Even
Plato the luminous finds it impossible to overpass the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
shadows of pagan interpretations. "In regard to the
facts of a future life, a man," said Phædo, "must either
learn or find out their nature; or, if he cannot do this,
take at any rate the best and least assailable of human
words, and, borne on this as on a raft, perform in
peril the voyage of life, unless he should be able to
accomplish the journey with less risk and danger on
a surer vessel&mdash;some word Divine." Now Israel had
a Divine word; and life was not perilous.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The problem which appears again and again in
Moses' relation with the people is that of the theocratic
idea as against the grasping at immediate success.
At various points, from the start in Egypt onwards,
the opportunity of assuming a regal position comes to
Moses. He is virtually dictator, and he might be king.
But a rare singleness of mind keeps him true to
Jehovah's lordship, which he endeavours to stamp on
the conscience of the people and the course of their
development. He has often to do so at the greatest
risk to himself. He holds back the people in what
seems the hour of advance, and it is the will of
Jehovah by which they are detained. The Unseen
King is their Helper and equally their Rhadamanthine
Judge; and on Moses falls the burden of forcing that
fact upon their minds.</p>

<p>Israel could never, according to Moses' idea, become
a great people in the sense in which the nations of
the world were great. Amongst them greatness was
sought in despite of morality, in defiance of all that
Jehovah commanded. Israel might never be great in
wealth, territory, influence, but she was to be true.
She existed for Jehovah, while the gods of other
nations existed for them, had no part to play without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
them. Jehovah was not to be overborne either by the
will or the needs of His people. He was the self-existent
Lord. The Name did not represent a supernatural
assistance which could be secured on terms,
or by any authorised person. Moses himself, though
he entreated Jehovah, did not change Him. His own
desire was sometimes thwarted; and he had often to
give the oracle with sorrow and disappointment.</p>

<p>Moses is not the priest of the people: the priesthood
comes in as a ministering body, necessary for religious
ends and ideas, but never governing, never even interpreting.
It is singular from this point of view that the
so-called Priests' Code should be attributed confidently
to a caste ambitious of ruling or practically enthroned.
Wellhausen ridicules the "fine" distinction between
hierocracy and theocracy. He affirms that government
of God is the same thing as rule of priest; and he may
affirm this because he thinks so. The Book of Numbers,
as it stands, might have been written to prove that
they are not equivalent; and Wellhausen himself
shows that they are not by more than one of his
conclusions. The theocracy, he says, is in its nature
intimately allied to the Roman Catholic Church, which
is, in fact, its child; and on the whole he prefers to
speak of the Jewish Church rather than the theocracy.
But if any modern religious body is to be named as a
child of the Hebrew <i>theocracy</i>, it must not be one in
which the priest intervenes continually between faith
and God. Wellhausen says again that "the sacred
constitution of Judaism was an artificial product" as
contrasted with the broadly human indigenous element,
the real idea of man's relation to God; and when a
priesthood, as in later Judaism, becomes the governing
body, God is, so far, dethroned. Now Moses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
did not give to Aaron greater power than he himself
possessed, and his own power is constantly represented
as exercised in submission to Jehovah. A
theocracy might be established without a priesthood;
in fact, the mediation of the prophet approaches the
ideal far more than that of the priest. But in the
beginnings of Israel the priesthood was required,
received a subordinate place of its own, to which it was
throughout rigidly confined. As for priestly government,
that, we may say, has no support anywhere in
the Pentateuch.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The Book of Numbers, called also "In the wilderness,"
opens with the second month of the second year
after the exodus, and goes on to the arrival of the tribes
in the plains of Moab by the Jordan. As a whole it
may be said to carry out the historical and religious
ideas of Exodus and Leviticus: and both the history
and the legislation flow into three main channels.
They go to establish the separateness of Israel as a
people, the separateness of the tribe of Levi and the
priesthood, and the separateness and authority of
Jehovah. The first of these objects is served by the
accounts of the census, of the redemption of the first-born,
the laws of national atonement and distinctive
dress, and generally the Divine discipline of Israel
recorded in the course of the book. The second line
of purpose may be traced in the careful enumeration of
the Levites; the minute allocation of duties connected
with the tabernacle to the Gershonites, the Kohathites,
and the Merarites; the special consecration of the
Aaronic priesthood; the elaboration of ceremonials
requiring priestly service; and various striking incidents,
such as the judgment of Korah and his company, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the budding of Aaron's almond twig. Lastly, the institution
of some cleansing rites, the sin offering of
chap. xix. for example, the details of punishment that
fell upon offenders against the law, the precautions
enjoined with regard to the ark and the sanctuary,
together with the multiplication of sacrifices, went to
emphasise the sanctity of worship and the holiness of
the unseen King. The book is sacerdotal; it is marked
even more by a physical and moral Puritanism, exceedingly
stringent at many points.</p>

<p>The whole system of religious observance and
priestly ministration set forth in the Mosaic books may
seem difficult to account for, not indeed as a national
development, but as a moral and religious gain. We
are ready to ask how God could in any sense have
been the author of a code of laws imposing so many
intricate ceremonies, which required a whole tribe of
Levites and priests to perform them. Where was the
spiritual use that justified the system, as necessary, as
wise, as Divine? Inquiries like these will arise in the
minds of believing men, and sufficient answer must be
sought for.</p>

<p>In the following way the religious worth and therefore
the inspiration of the ceremonial law may be found.
The primitive notion that Jehovah was the exclusive
property of Israel, the pledged patron of the nation,
tended to impair the sense of His moral purity. An
ignorant people inclined to many forms of immorality
could not have a right conception of the Divine holiness;
and the more it was accepted as a commonplace of
faith that Jehovah knew them alone of all the families
of the earth, the more was right belief towards Him
imperilled. A psalmist who in the name of God reproves
"the wicked" indicates the danger: "Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself."
Now the priesthood, the sacrifices, all provisions for
maintaining the sanctity of the ark and the altar, and
all rules of ceremonial cleansing, were means of preventing
that fatal error. The Israelites began without
the solemn temples and impressive mysteries that made
the religion of Egypt venerable. In the desert and in
Canaan, till the time of Solomon, the rude arrangements
of semi-civilised life kept religion at an everyday level.
The domestic makeshifts and confusion of the early
period, the frequent alarms and changes which for
centuries the nation had to endure, must have made
culture of any kind, even religious culture, almost
impossible to the mass of the people. The law in its
very complexity and stringency provided a needful
safeguard and means of education. Moses had been
acquainted with a great sacerdotal system. Not only
would it appear to him natural to originate something
of a like kind, but he would see no other means of
creating in rude times the idea of the Divine holiness.
For himself he found inspiration and prophetic power
in laying the foundation of the system; and once
initiated, its development necessarily followed. With
the progress of civilisation the law had to keep pace,
meeting the new circumstances and needs of each
succeeding period. Certainly the genius of the Pentateuch,
and in particular of the Book of Numbers, is not
liberating. The tone is that of theocratic rigour. But
the reason is quite clear; the development of the law
was determined by the necessities and dangers of
Israel in the exodus, in the wilderness, and in idolatrous,
seductive Canaan.</p>

<p>Opening with an account of the census, the Book of
Numbers evidently stood, from the first, quite distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
from the previous books as a composition or compilation.
The mustering of the tribes gave an opportunity
of passing from one group of documents to another,
from one stage of the history to another. But the
memoranda brought together in Numbers are of various
character. Administrative, legislative, and historical
sources are laid under contribution. The records have
been arranged as far as possible in chronological order;
and there are traces, as for instance in the second account
of the striking of the rock by Moses, of a careful
gathering up of materials not previously used, at least
in the precise form they now have. The compilers
collected and transcribed with the most reverent care,
and did not venture in any case to reject. The historical
notices are for some reason anything but consecutive,
and the greater part of the time covered by
the book is virtually passed over. On the other hand
some passages repeat details in a way that has no
parallel in the rest of the Mosaic books. The effect
generally is that of a compilation made under difficulties
by a scribe or scribes who were scrupulous to preserve
everything relating to the great lawgiver and the
dealings of God with Israel.</p>

<p>Recent criticism is positive in its assertion that the
book contains several strata of narrative; and there
are certain passages, the accounts of Korah's revolt
and of Dathan and Abiram, for instance, where without
such a clew the history must seem not a little confused.
In a sense this is disconcerting. The ordinary reader
finds it difficult to understand why an inspired book
should appear at any point incomplete or incoherent.
The hostile critic again is ready to deny the credibility
of the whole. But the honesty of the writing is proved
by the very characteristics that make some statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
hard to interpret and some of the records difficult to
receive. The theory that a journal of the wanderings
was kept by Moses or under his direction is quite
untenable. Dismissing that, we fall back on the belief
that contemporary records of some incidents, and
traditions early committed to writing formed the basis
of the book. The documents were undoubtedly ancient
at the time of their final recension, whensoever and by
whomsoever it was made.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of Numbers refers to the
second year after the exodus from Egypt, and to what
took place in the fortieth year, after the departure from
Kadesh. Regarding the intermediate time we are told
little but that the camp was shifted from one place to
another in the wilderness. Why the missing details
have not survived in any form cannot now be made
out. It is no sufficient explanation to say that those
events alone are preserved which struck the popular
imagination. On the other hand, to ascribe what we
have to unscrupulous or pious fabrication is at once
unpardonable and absurd. Some may be inclined to
think that the book consists entirely of accidental
scraps of tradition, and that inspiration would have
come better to its end if the religious feelings of the
people had received more attention, and we had been
shown the gradual use of Israel out of ignorance and
semi-barbarism. Yet even for the modern historical
sense the book has its own claim, by no means slight,
to high estimation and close study. These are venerable
records, reaching back to the time they profess to
describe, and presenting, though with some traditional
haze, the important incidents of the desert journey.</p>

<p>Turning from the history to the legislation, we have
to inquire whether the laws regarding priests and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Levites, sacrifices and cleansings, bear uniformly the
colour of the wilderness. The origins are certainly of
the Mosaic time, and some of the statutes elaborated
here must be founded on customs and beliefs older
even than the exodus. Yet in form many enactments
are apparently later than the time of Moses; and it
does not seem well to maintain that laws requiring
what was next to impossible in the wilderness were,
during the journey, given and enforced as they now
stand by a wise legislator. Did Moses require, for
instance, that five shekels, "of the shekel of the
sanctuary," should be paid for the ransom of the first-born
son of a household, at a time when many families
must have had no silver and no means of obtaining it?
Does not this statute, like another which is spoken of
as deferred till the settlement in Canaan, imply a fixed
order and medium of exchange? For the sake of a
theory which is intended to honour Moses as the only
legislator of Israel, is it well to maintain that he
imposed conditions which could not be carried out, and
that he actually prepared the way for neglect of his
own code?</p>

<p>It is beyond our range to discuss the date of the
compilation of Numbers as compared with the other
Pentateuchal books, or the age of the "Jehovistic"
documents as compared with the "Priests' Code."
This, however, is of less moment, since it is now
becoming clear that attempts to settle these dates can
only darken the main question&mdash;the antiquity of the
original records and enactments. The assertion that
Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers belong to an age later
than Ezekiel is of course meant to apply to the present
form of the books. But even in this sense it is
misleading. Those who make it themselves assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
that many things in the law and the history are of far
older date, based indeed on what at the time of Ezekiel
must have been immemorial usage. The main legislation
of the Pentateuch must have existed in the time
of Josiah, and even then possessed the authority of
ancient observance. The priesthood, the ark, sacrifice
and feast, the shewbread, the ephod, can be traced back
beyond the time of David to that of Samuel and Eli,
quite apart from the testimony of the Books of Moses.
Moreover, it is impossible to believe that the formula
"The Lord said unto Moses" was invented at a late
date as the authority for statutes. It was the invariable
accompaniment of the ancient rule, the mark of an
origin already recognised. The various legislative provisions
we shall have to consider had their sanction
under the great ordinance of the law and the inspired
prophetism which directed its use and maintained its
adaptation to the circumstances of the people. The
religious and moral code as a whole, designed to secure
profound reverence towards God and the purity of
national faith, continued the legislation of Moses, and at
every point was the task of men who guarded as sacred
the ideas of the founder and were themselves taught
of God. The entire law was acknowledged by Christ
in this sense as possessing the authority of the great
lawgiver's own commission.</p>

<p>It has been said that "the inspired condition would
seem to be one which produces a generous indifference
to pedantic accuracy in matters of fact, and a supreme
absorbing concern about the moral and religious
significance of facts." If the former part of this
statement were true, the historical books of the Bible,
and, we may say, in particular the Book of Numbers,
would deserve no attention as history. But nothing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
more striking in a survey of our book than the clear
unhesitating way in which incidents are set forth, even
where moral and religious ends could not be much
served by the detail that is freely used. The account
of the muster-roll is a case in point. There we find
what may be called "pedantic accuracy." The enumeration
of each tribe is given separately, and the formula
is repeated, "by their families, by their fathers' houses,
according to the number of the names from twenty
years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to
war." Again, the whole of the seventh chapter, the
longest in the book, is taken up with an account of
the offerings of the tribes, made at the dedication of
the altar. These oblations are presented day after
day by the heads of the twelve tribes in order, and
each tribe brings precisely the same gifts&mdash;"one
silver charger, the weight thereof was an hundred and
thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels
after the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them
full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering;
one golden spoon of ten shekels full of incense; one
young bullock, one ram, one he-lamb of the first year
for a burnt offering; one male of the goats for a sin
offering; and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two
oxen, five rams, five he-goats, five he-lambs of the first
year." Now the difficulty at once occurs that in the
wilderness, according to Exod. xvi., there was no
bread, no flour, that manna was the food of the people.
In Numb. xi. 6 the complaint of the children of Israel
is recorded: "Now our soul is dried away; there is
nothing at all: we have nought save this manna to
look to." In Josh. v. 10 ff. it is stated that, after the
passage of the Jordan, "they kept the passover on the
fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Jericho. And they did eat of the old corn of the land
on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes
and parched corn in the self-same day. And the
manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of
the old corn of the land." To the compilers of the
Book of Numbers the statement that tribe after tribe
brought offerings of fine flour mingled with oil, which
could only have been obtained from Egypt or from
some Arabian valley at a distance, must have been as
hard to receive as it is to us. Nevertheless, the assertion
is repeated no less than twelve times. What
then? Do we impugn the sincerity of the historians?
Are we to suppose them careless of the fact? Do we
not rather perceive that in the face of what seemed
insuperable difficulties they held to what they had
before them as authentic records? No writer could be
inspired and at the same time indifferent to accuracy.
If there is one thing more than another on which
we may rely, it is that the authors of these books
of Scripture have done their very utmost by careful
inquiry and recension to make their account of what
took place in the wilderness full and precise. Absolute
sincerity and scrupulous carefulness are essential conditions
for dealing successfully with moral and religious
themes; and we have all evidence that the compilers
had these qualities. But in order to reach historical
fact they had to use the same kind of means as we
employ; and this qualifying statement, with all that it
involves, applies to the whole contents of the book we
are to consider. Our dependence with regard to the
events recorded is on the truthfulness but not the
omniscience of the men, whoever they were, who from
traditions, records, scrolls of law, and venerable
memoranda compiled this Scripture as we have it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
They wrought under the sense of sacred duty, and
found through that the inspiration which gives perennial
value to their work. With this in view we shall
take up the various matters of history and legislation.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Recurring now, for a little, to the spirit of the Book
of Numbers, we find in the ethical passages its highest
note and power as an inspired writing. The standard
of judgment is not by any means that of Christianity.
It belongs to an age when moral ideas had often to
be enforced with indifference to human life; when,
conversely, the plagues and disasters that befell men
were always connected with moral offences. It belongs
to an age when the malediction of one who claimed
supernatural insight was generally believed to carry
power with it, and the blessing of God meant earthly
prosperity. And the notable fact is that, side by side
with these beliefs, righteousness of an exalted kind is
strenuously taught. For example, the reverence for
Moses and Aaron, usually so characteristic of the Book
of Numbers, is seen falling into the background when
the Divine judgment of their fault is recorded; and the
earnestness shown is nothing less than sublime. In
the course of the legislation Aaron is invested with
extraordinary official dignity; and Moses appears at
his best in the matter of Eldad and Medad when
he says, "Enviest thou for my sake? Would God
that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the
Lord would put His Spirit upon them." Yet Numbers
records the sentence pronounced upon the brothers:
"Because ye believed Me not, to sanctify Me in the
eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not
bring this congregation into the land which I have
given them." And more severe is the form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
condemnation recorded in chap. xxvii. 14: "Because
ye rebelled against My word in the wilderness of
Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify Me
at the waters before their eyes." The moral strain of
the book is keen in the punishment inflicted on a
Sabbath-breaker, in the destination to death of the
whole congregation for murmuring against God&mdash;a
judgment which, at the entreaty of Moses, was not
revoked, but only deferred&mdash;and again in the condemnation
to death of every soul that sins presumptuously.
On the other hand, the provision of refuge
cities for the unwitting man-slayer shows the Divine
righteousness at one with mercy.</p>

<p>It must be confessed the book has another note.
In order that Israel might reach and conquer Canaan
there had to be war; and the warlike spirit is frankly
breathed. There is no thought of converting enemies
like the Midianites into friends; every man of them
must be put to the sword. The census enumerates
the men fit for war. The primitive militarism is consecrated
by Israel's necessity and destiny. When the
desert march is over, Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe
of Manasseh must not turn peacefully to their sheep
and cattle on the east side of Jordan; they must send
their men of war across the river to maintain the unity
of the nation by running the hazard of battle with the
rest. Experience of this inevitable discipline brought
moral gain. Religion could use even war to lift the
people into the possibility of higher life.</p>

<h2>
II<br /><br />

<i>THE CENSUS AND THE CAMP</i></h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Mustering</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> i. 1-46</h4>

<p>From the place of high spiritual knowledge, where
through the revelation of God in covenant and
law Israel has been constituted His nation and His
Church, the tribes must now march with due order
and dignity. The sense of a Divine calling and of
responsibility to the Highest will react on the whole
arrangements made for the ordinary tasks and activities
of men. Social aims may unite those who have them
in common, and the emergencies of a nation will lay
constraint on patriotic souls. But nothing so binds
men together as a common vocation to do God's will
and maintain His faith. These ideas are to be traced
in the whole account of the mustering of the warriors
and the organisation of the camp. We review it feeling
that the dominating thought of a Divine call to spiritual
duty and progress is far from having control of modern
Christendom. Under the New Covenant there is a
distribution of grace to every one, an endowment of
each according to his faith with priestly and even
kingly powers. No chief men swear fealty to Christ
on behalf of the tribes that gather to His standard;
but each believer devotes himself to the service and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
receives his own commission. Yet, while the first
thought is that of personal honour and liberty, there
should follow at once the desire, the determination, to
find one's fit place in the camp, in the march, in the
war. The unity is imperative, for there is one body
and one spirit, even as we are called in one hope of
our calling. The commission each receives is not to
be a free-lance in the Divine warfare, but to take his
right place in the ranks; and that place he must find.</p>

<p>The enumeration, as recorded in chap. i., was not
to be of all Israelites, but of men from twenty years
old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war.
From Sinai to Canaan was no long journey, and fighting
might soon be required. The muster was by way of
preparation for conflicts in the wilderness and for the
final struggle. It is significant that Aaron is shown
associated with Moses in gathering the results. We
see not only a preparation for war, but also for the
poll tax or tithe to be levied in support of the priests
and Levites. A sequel to the enumeration is to be
found in chap. xviii. 21: "And unto the children of
Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for
an inheritance, in return for their service which they
serve, even the service of the tent of meeting." The
Levites again were to give, out of what they received,
a tenth part for the maintenance of the priests. The
enactment when carried into effect would make the
support of those who ministered in holy things a term
of the national constitution.</p>

<p>Now taking the census as intended to impress the
personal duties of service in war and contribution for
religious ends, we find in it a valuable lesson for all
who acknowledge the Divine authority. Not remotely
may the command be interpreted thus. Take the sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of them, that they may realise that God takes the sum
of them and expects of every man service commensurate
with his powers. The claim of Jehovah went side by
side with the claim on behalf of the nation, for He was
Head of the nation. But God is equally the Head of
all who have their life from Him; and this numbering
of the Hebrews points to a census which is accurately
registered and never falls short of the sum of a people
by a single unit. Whoever can fight the battle of
righteousness, serve the truth by witness-bearing, aid
in relieving one weak, or help religion by personal
example and willing gift&mdash;every possible servant of
God, who is also by the very possession of life and
privilege a debtor of God, is numbered in the daily
census of His providence. The measure of the ability
of each is known. "To whomsoever much is given,
of him shall much be required." The Divine regard of
our lives and estimate of our powers, and the accompanying
claim made upon us, are indeed far from being
understood; even members of the Church are strangely
ignorant of their duty. But is it thought that because
no Sinai shrouded in awful smoke towers above us,
and now we are encamped at the foot of Calvary, where
one great offering was made for our redemption, therefore
we are free in any sense from the service Israel
was expected to render? Do any hold themselves
relieved from the tithe because they are Christ's freemen,
and shirk the warfare because they already enjoy
the privileges of the victors? These are the ignorant,
whose complacent excuses show that they do not
understand the law of Divine religion.</p>

<p>True, the position of the Church among us is not of
the kind which the Mosaic law gave to the priesthood
in Israel. Tithes are gathered, not from those only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
who are numbered within the Church and acknowledge
obligation, but also from those outside, and always by
another authority than that of Divine commandment.
In this way the whole matter of the support of religion
is confused in these lands both for members of the
national Churches and for those beyond their borders.
Successfully as the old Hebrew scheme may once have
wrought, it is now hopelessly out of line with the
development of society. The census does not in any
way determine what a national Church can claim.
Aaron does not stand beside Moses to watch the enrolment
of the tribes, families, and households as they
come to be numbered. Yet, by the highest law of all,
which neither Church nor State can alter, the demand
for service is enforced. There is a warlike duty from
which none are exempt, from which there is no discharge.
Although the ideal of an organised humanity appears
as yet far off in our schemes of government and social
melioration, providentially it is being carried into effect.
Laws are at work that need no human administration.
By the Divine ordinance generous effort for the common
good and the ends of religion is made imperative.
Obedience brings its reward: "The liberal deviseth
liberal things, and by liberal things shall he stand."
Neglect is also punished: the sure result of selfishness
is an impoverished life.</p>

<p>The census is described as having been thoroughly
organised. Keil and Delitzsch think that the registering
may have taken place "according to the classification
adopted at Jethro's suggestion for the administration
of justice&mdash;viz., in thousands, hundreds, fifties, and
tens." They also defend the total of six hundred and
three thousand five hundred and fifty, which is precisely
the same as that reached apparently nine months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
before. It is an obvious explanation of what appears
a perplexing agreement, that the enumeration may have
occupied nine months. But the number is certainly
large, much larger than the muster-rolls of the Book
of Judges would lead us to expect, if we reckon back
from them. Nor can any explanation be given that
is satisfactory in all respects. We may shrink from
interfering with these numerical statements carefully
set down thousands of years ago. Yet we feel that the
haze of remoteness hangs over this roll of the tribes
and all after-reckonings based upon it.</p>

<p>Of the twelve princes named in chap. i. 5-15, as
overseers of the census, Nahshon, son of Amminadab,
of the tribe of Judah, has peculiar distinction. His
name is found in the genealogy of David given in the
Book of Ruth (chap. iv. 20). It also appears in the
"book of the generation of Jesus Christ" (Matt. i.)
and the roll of Joseph's ancestry recorded by St. Luke.
One after another in that honourable line which gave
the Hebrews their Psalmist and the world its Saviour
is but a name to us. Yet the life represented by the
name Nahshon, spent mainly in the wilderness, had
its part in far-off results; and so had many a life, not
even named&mdash;the hard lives of brave fathers and
burdened mothers in Israel, who, on the weary march
through the desert, had their sorrow and pain, their
scanty joy and hope. Far away is the endurance of
those Hebrew men and women, yet it is related to
our own religion, our salvation. The discipline of the
wilderness made men of courage, women great in faith.
Beneath their feet the Arabian sand burned, above
them the sun flamed; they heard alarms of war, and
followed the pillar of smoke for their appointed time,
looking, even when they knew they looked in vain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
for the land beyond of which Jehovah had spoken.
Unaware of their nation's destiny, they toiled and
suffered to serve a great Divine plan which in the
course of the ages came to ripeness. And the thought
brings help to ourselves. We too have our desert
journey, our duty and hardship, with an outlook not
merely personal. It is our privilege, if we will take
it so, to aid the Divine plan for the humanity that is
to be, the great brotherhood in which Christ shall see
of the travail of His soul and be satisfied. Like a
prince of Judah, or a humble nameless mother in
Israel, each may find abiding dignity of life in doing
well some allotted part in the great enterprise.</p>

<p>The age of service fixed for the men of the tribes
may yield suggestions for our time. It is not of
warlike service we have to think, but of that which
depends on spiritual influence and intellectual power.
And we may ask whether the limits on one side and
the other have any parallel for us. Young men
and women, having reached the age of bodily and
mental vigour, are to hold themselves enrolled in the
ranks of the army of God. There is a time of learning
and preparation, when knowledge is to be acquired,
when the principles of life are to be grasped, and the
soul is to find its inspiration through personal faith.
Then there should come that self-consecration by which
response is made to the claim of God. Neither should
that be premature, nor should it be deferred. When
an aimless, irresolute adolescence is followed by years
of drifting and experimenting without clear religious
purpose, the best opportunity of life is thrown away.
And this far too frequently occurs among those on
whom parental influence and the finest Christian
teaching have been expended. The time arrives when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
such young men and women should begin to serve the
Church and the world; but they are still unprepared
because they have not considered the great questions
of duty, and seen that they have a part to play on the
field of endeavour. It is true, no time can be fixed.
The public service of Christ has been begun by some
in very early youth; and the results have justified
their adventure. From the humble tasks they first
undertook they have gone on steadily to places of
high responsibility, never once looking back, learning
while they taught, gaining faith while they imparted it
to others. Each for himself or herself, in this matter
of supreme importance, must seek the guidance and
realise the vocation of God. But delay is often
indulged, and the twentieth, even the thirtieth year,
passes without a single effort in the holy service. One
could wish for a Divine conscription, a command laid
on every one in youth to be ready at a certain day and
hour to take the sword of the Spirit.</p>

<p>On the other side also many need to reconsider.
No time was fixed for the end of the services to which
the Israelites were summoned. As long as a man
could carry arms he was to hold himself ready for
the field. Not the increasing cares of his family, not
the disinclination which comes with years, was to
weigh against the ordinance of Jehovah. But service
now, however cheerfully it may be rendered in early
manhood and womanhood, is often renounced altogether
when knowledge and power are coming to
ripeness with the experience of life. Doubtless there
are many excuses to be made for heads of households
who are leaving their young folk to represent them in
religion, and pretty much in everything outside the
mere maintaining of existence or the enjoyment of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
The demands of public service all round are sometimes
quite out of proportion to the available time and
strength. Yet the Christian duty never lapses; and it
is a great evil when the balance is wanting between
old and young, tried and untried.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Tribe of Levi</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> i. 47-54</h4>

<p>The tribe of Levi is not numbered with the rest.
No warlike service, no half-shekel for the sanctuary, is
to be exacted from the Levite. His contribution to the
general good is to be of another kind. Pitching their
tents about the tabernacle, the men of this tribe are to
guard the sanctuary from careless or rude intrusion,
and minister unto it, taking charge of its parts and
furniture, dismantling it when it is to be removed, setting
it up again when another stage of the march is over.</p>

<p>In this order it is implied that, although according to
the ideal of the Mosaic law Israel was to be a holy
nation, yet the reality fell very far short of it. "The
Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto all the
congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto
them, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am
holy" (Lev. xix. 1, 2). Again and again this command
of consecration is given. But neither in the wilderness,
nor throughout the pre-exilic history, nor after
the Babylonian affliction had purged the nation of
idolatry, was Israel so holy that access to the sanctuary
could be allowed to the men of the tribes. Rather, as
time went by, did the need for special consecration of
those about the temple become more evident. Although
by statute the tribe of Levi was well provided
for, it cannot be said that the life of the Levite was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
any time enviable from a worldly point of view; at the
best it was a kind of honourable poverty. Something
else than mere priest-craft upheld the system which
separated the whole tribe; something else made the
Levites content with their position. There was a real
and imperative sense of need to guard the sanctities
of religion, a jealousy for the honour of God, which,
originating with Moses and the priesthood, was felt
throughout the whole nation.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the scheme of Israel's religion
required this array of servants of the sanctuary.
Under Christianity the ideal of the life of faith and the
manner of worship are entirely different. A way into
the holy place of the Divine presence is now open to
every believer, and each may have boldness to enter it.
But even under Christianity there is a general failure
from holiness, from the spiritual worship of God.
And as among the Hebrews, so among Christians,
the need for a body of guardians of sacred truth and
pure religion has been widely acknowledged. Throughout
the Church generally down to the Reformation,
and still in countries like Russia and Spain, we may
even say in England, the condition of things is like
that in Israel. A people conscious of ignorance and
secularity, feeling nevertheless the need of religion,
willingly supports the "priests," sometimes a great
army, who conduct the worship of God. There is
nothing to wonder at here, in a sense; much, indeed,
for which to be thankful. Yet the system is not the
New Testament one; and those who endeavour to
realise the ideal are not to be branded and scorned as
schismatics. They should be honoured for their noble
effort to reach and use the holy consecration of the
Christian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Camp</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> ii</h4>

<p>The second chapter is devoted to the arrangement
of the camp and the position of the various tribes
on the march. The front is eastward, and Judah has
the post of honour in the van; at its head Nahshon
son of Amminadab. Issachar and Zebulun, closely
associated with Judah in the genealogy as descended
from Leah, are the others in front of the tabernacle.
The right wing, to the south of the tabernacle, is composed
of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, again connected
by the hereditary tie, Gad by descent from the "handmaid
of Leah." The seniority of Reuben is apparently
acknowledged by the position of the tribe at the head
of the right wing, which would sustain the first attack
of the desert clans; for dignity and onerous duty go
together. The rear is formed by Ephraim, Manasseh,
and Benjamin, connected with one another by descent
from Rachel. Northward, on the left of the advance,
Dan, Asher, and Naphtali have their position. Standards
of divisions and ensigns of families are not
forgotten in the description of the camp; and Jewish
tradition has ventured to state what some of these
were. Judah is said to have been a lion (compare
"the lion that is of the tribe of Judah," Rev. v. 5);
Reuben, the image of a human head; Ephraim, an
ox; and Dan an eagle. If this tradition is accepted,
it will connect the four main ensigns of Israel with
the vision of Ezekiel in which the same four figures
were united in each of the four living creatures that
issued from the fiery cloud.</p>

<p>The picture of the great organised camp and orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
march of Israel is interesting; but it presents a contrast
to the disorganised, disorderly condition of human
society in every land and every age. While it may be
said that there are nations leagued in creed, allied by
descent, which form the van; that others, similarly connected
more or less, constitute the right and left wings
of the advancing host; and the rest, straggling far
behind, bring up the rear&mdash;this is but a very imaginative
representation of the fact. No people advances
as with one mind and one heart; no group of nations
can be said to have a single standard. Time and
destiny urge on the host, and all is to be won by
steady resolute endeavour. Yet some are encamped,
while others are moving about restlessly or engaged
in petty conflicts that have nothing to do with moral
gain. There should be unity; but one division is
embroiled with another, tribe crosses swords with
tribe. The truth is that as Israel came far short of
real spiritual organisation and due disposition of its
forces to serve a common end, so it is still with the
human race. Nor do the schemes that are occasionally
tried to some extent promise a remedy for our disorder.
For the symbol of our most holy faith is not set in the
midst by most of those who aim at social organisation,
nor do they dream of seeking a better country, that is,
a heavenly. The description of the camp of Israel has
something to teach us still. Without the Divine law
there is no progress, without a Divine rallying-point
there is no unity. Faith must control, the standard
of Christianity must show the way; otherwise the
nations will only wander aimlessly, and fight and die
in the desert.</p>

III<br /><br />

<i>PRIESTS AND LEVITES</i></h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Priesthood</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> iii. 1-10</h4>

<p>In the opening verse of this chapter, which relates
to the designation of the priesthood, Moses is
named, for once, after his brother. According to the
genealogy of Exod. vi., Aaron was the elder; and
this may have led to the selection of his as the priestly
house&mdash;which again would give him priority in a passage
relating to the hierarchy. If Moses had chosen, his
undoubted claims would have secured the priestly office
for his family. But he did not desire this; and
indeed the duties of administrative head of the people
were sufficiently heavy. Aaron was apparently fitted
for the sacerdotal office, and without peculiar qualifications
for any other. He seems to have had no originating
power, but to have been ready to fall in with and
direct the routine of ceremonial worship. And we
may assume that Moses knew the surviving sons of
Aaron to be of the stamp of their father, likely to inaugurate
a race of steady, devoted servants of the altar.</p>

<p>Yet all Aaron's sons had not been of this quiet
disposition. Nadab and Abihu, the two eldest, had
sinned presumptuously, and brought on themselves the
doom of death. No fewer than five times is their fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
referred to in the books of Leviticus and Numbers.
Whatever that strange fire was which they put in their
censers and used before the Lord, the judgment that
befell them was signal and impressive. And here
reference is made to the fact that they died without
issue, as if to mark the barrenness of the sacrilegious.
Did it not appear that inherent disqualification for the
priesthood, the moral blindness or self-will which was
shown in their presumptuous act, had been foreseen by
God, who wrote them childless in His book? This
race must not be continued. Israel must not begin
with priests who desecrate the altar.</p>

<p>Whether the death of those two sons of Aaron came
by an unexpected stroke, or was a doom inflicted after
judgment in which their father had to acquiesce, the
terrible event left a most effectual warning. The order
appointed for the incense offering, and all other sacred
duties, would thenceforth be rigidly observed. And the
incident&mdash;revived continually for the priests when they
studied the Law&mdash;must have had especial significance
through their knowledge of the use and meaning of
fire in idolatrous worship. The temptation was often
felt, against which the fate of Nadab and Abihu set
every priest on his guard, to mingle the supposed
virtue of other religious symbols with the sanctities
of Jehovah. Who can doubt that priests of Israel,
secretly tempted by the rites of sun-worship, might
have gone the length of carrying the fire of Baal into
Jehovah's temple, if the memory of this doom had
not held back the hand? Here also the degradation
of the burnt offering by taking flame from a
common fire was by implication forbidden. The source
of that which is the symbol of Divine purity must be
sacredly pure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who minister in holy things have still a
corresponding danger, and may find here a needed
warning. The fervour shown in sacred worship and
work must have an origin that is purely religious. He
who pleads earnestly with God on behalf of men, or
rises to impassioned appeal in beseeching men to
repent, appearing as an ambassador of Christ urged
by the love of souls, has to do not with symbols, but
with truths, ideas, Divine mysteries infinitely more
sacred than the incense and fire of Old Testament
worship. For the Hebrew priest outward and formal
consecration sufficed. For the minister of the New
Testament, the purity must be of the heart and soul.
Yet it is possible for the heat of alien zeal, of mere
self-love or official ambition, to be carried into duties
the most solemn that fall to the lot of man; and if it is
not in the Spirit of God a preacher speaks or offers
the sacrifice of thanksgiving, if some other inspiration
makes him eloquent and gives his voice its tremulous
notes, sin like that of Nadab and Abihu is committed,
or rather a sin greater than theirs. With profound
sorrow it must be confessed that the "strange fire"
from idolatrous altars too often desecrates the service
of God. Excitement is sought by those who minister
in order that the temperament may be raised to the
degree necessary for free and ardent speech; and it
is not always of a purely religious kind. Those who
hear may for a time be deceived by the pretence of
unction, by dramatic tones, by alien fire. But the
difference is felt when it cannot be defined; and on
the spiritual life of the ministrant the effect is simply
fatal.</p>

<p>The surviving sons of Aaron, Eleazar and Ithamar,
were anointed and "consecrated to minister in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
priest's office." The form of designation is indicated
by the expression, "whose hand he filled to exercise
priesthood." This has been explained as referring to
a portion of the ceremony described in Lev. viii. 26 f.
"And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was
before the Lord, he took one unleavened cake, and one
cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on
the fat, and upon the right thigh: and he put the whole
upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his
sons, and waved them for a wave offering before the
Lord." The explanation is scarcely satisfactory. In
the long ceremony of consecration this incident was
not the only one to which the expression "filling the
hand" was applied; and something simpler must be
found as the source of an idiomatic phrase. To fill the
hand would naturally mean to pay or hire, and we
seem to be pointed to the time when for the patriarchal
priesthood there was substituted one that was official,
supported by the community. In Exod. xxviii. 41
and in Lev. viii. 33, the expression in question is
used in a general sense incompatible with its reference
to any particular portion of the ceremony of consecration.
It is also used in Judges xvii., where to all
appearance the consecration of Micah's Levite implied
little else than the first payment on account of a
stipulated hire. The phrase, then, appears to be a
mark of history, and carries the mind back to the
simple origin of the priestly office.</p>

<p>Eleazar and Ithamar "ministered in the priest's
office in the presence of Aaron their father." So far
as the narrative of the Pentateuch gives information,
there were originally, and during the whole of the
wilderness journey, no other priests than Aaron and
his sons. Nadab and Abihu having died, there remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
but the two besides their father. Phinehas the
son of Eleazar appears in the history, but is not called
a priest, nor has he any priestly functions. What he
does is indeed quite apart from the holy office. And
this early restriction of the number is not only in
favour of the Pentateuchal history, but partly explains
the fact that in Deuteronomy the priests and Levites
are apparently identified. Taking at their very heaviest
the duties specially laid on the priests, much must
have fallen to the share of their assistants, who had
their own consecration as ministers of the sanctuary.
It is certain that members of the Levitical families
were in course of time admitted to the full status of
priests.</p>

<p>The direction is given in ver. 10, "Thou shalt
appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their
priesthood; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be
put to death." This is rigorously exclusive, and seems
to contrast with the statements of Deuteronomy, "At
that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear
the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before
the Lord to minister unto Him and to <i>bless in His
name</i> unto this day" (x. 8); and again, "The priests
the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi, shall have no
portion nor inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the
offerings of the Lord made by fire, and His inheritance"
(xviii. 1); and once more, "Moses wrote the
law and delivered it unto the priests, the sons of Levi,
which bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and
unto all the elders of Israel" (xxxi. 9). Throughout
Deuteronomy the priests are never called sons of
Aaron, nor is Aaron called a priest. Whether the
cause of this apparent discrepancy is that Deuteronomy
regarded the arrangements for the priestly service in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
a different light, or that the distinction of priests from
Levites fell into abeyance and was afterwards revived,
the variation cannot be ignored. In the book of
Joshua "the children of Aaron the priest" appear on
a few occasions, and certain of the duties of high priest
are ascribed to Eleazar. Yet even in Joshua the
importance attached to the Aaronic house is far less
than in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers; and the
expression "the priests the Levites" occurs twice.
If we regard the origin of the Aaronic priesthood as
belonging to the Mosaic period, then the wars and
disturbances of the settlement in Canaan must have
entirely disorganised the system originally instituted.
In the days of the judges there seems to have been
no orderly observance of those laws which gave the
priesthood importance. Scattered Levites had to do
as they best could what was possible in the way of
sacrifice and purification. And this confusion may
have begun in the plain of Moab. The death of Aaron,
the personal insignificance of his sons, and still more
the death of Moses himself, would place the administration
of religious as well as secular affairs on an
entirely different footing. Memoranda preserved in
Leviticus and Numbers may therefore be more ancient
than those of Deuteronomy; and Deuteronomy,
describing the state of things before the passage of
Jordan, may in regard to the priesthood reflect the
conditions of a new development, the course of which
did not blend with the original design till after the
captivity.</p>

<p>The tribe of Levi is, according to ver. 6 ff., appointed
to minister to Aaron, and to keep his charge and that
of the congregation before the "tent of meeting," to
do the service of the tabernacle. For all the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
work connected with the sanctuary the Levites are
"wholly given unto Aaron on behalf of the children
of Israel." It was of course in accordance with the
patriarchal idea that each clan should have a hereditary
chief. Here, however, an arbitrary rule breaks in.
For Aaron was not by primogeniture head of the tribe
of Levi. He belonged to a younger family of the
tribe. The arrangements made by Moses as the
representative of God superseded the succession by
birthright. And this is by no means the only case
in which a law usually adhered to was broken through.
According to the history the high-priesthood did not
invariably follow the line of Eleazar. At a certain
point a descendant of Ithamar was for some reason
raised to the dignity. Samuel, too, became virtually a
priest, and rose higher than any high-priest before the
captivity, although he was not even of the tribe of
Levi. The law of spiritual endowment in his case set
the other aside. And is it not often so? The course
of providence brings forward the man who can guide
affairs. While his work lasts he is practically supreme.
It is useless to question or rebel. Neither in religion
nor in government can the appeal to Divine right or
to constitutional order alter the fact. Korah need
not revolt against Moses; nor may Aaron imagine
that he can push himself into the front. And Aaron,
as head of the tribe of Levi, and of the religious
administration, is safe in his own position so long
only as his office is well served. It is to responsibility
he is called, rather than to honour. Let him do his
duty, otherwise he will surely become merely a name
or a figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The First-born</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> iii. 11-13, 40-51</h4>

<p>These two passages supplement each other and
may be taken together. Jehovah claims the first-born
in Israel. He hallowed them unto Himself on the day
when He smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt.
They are now numbered from a month old and upward.
But instead of their being appointed personally to holy
service, the Levites are substituted for them. The
whole account supplies a scheme of the origin of the
sacerdotal tribe.</p>

<p>It has been questioned whether the number of the
first-born, which is 22,273, can in any way be made to
agree with the total number of the male Israelites,
previously stated at 603,550. Wellhausen is specially
contemptuous of a tradition or calculation which, he
says, would give an average of forty children to each
woman. But the difficulty partly yields if it is kept in
view that the Levites were separated for the service of
the sanctuary. Naturally it would be the heir-apparent
alone of each family group whose liability to this kind
of duty fell to be considered. The head of a household
was, according to the ancient reckoning, its priest. In
Abraham's family no one counted as a first-born but
Isaac. Now that a generation of Israelites is growing
up sanctified by the covenant, it appears fit that the
presumptive priest should either be devoted to
sacerdotal duty, or relieved of it by a Levite as his
substitute. Suppose each family had five tents, and
suppose further that the children born before the
exodus are not reckoned, the number will not be found
at all disproportionate. The absolute number remains
a difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Robertson Smith argues from his own premises
about the sanctity of the first-born. He repudiates the
notion that at one time the Hebrews actually sacrificed
all their first-born sons; yet he affirms that "there
must have been some point of attachment in ancient
custom for the belief that the Deity asked for such a
sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "I apprehend," he proceeds, "that all the
prerogatives of the first-born among Semitic peoples are
originally prerogatives of sanctity; the sacred blood
of the kin flows purest and strongest in him (Gen.
xlix. 3). Neither in the case of children nor in that
of cattle did the congenital holiness of the first-born
originally imply that they must be sacrificed or given
to the Deity on the altar, but only that if sacrifice was
to be made, they were the best and fittest because the
holiest victims." The passage in Numbers may be
confidently declared to be far from any such conception.
The special fitness for sacrifice of the first-born of an
animal is assumed: the fitness of the heir of a family,
again, is plainly not to <i>become</i> a sacrifice, but to offer
sacrifice. The first-born of the Egyptians died. But
it is the life, the holy activity of His own people, not
their death, God desires. And this holy activity, rising
to its highest function in the first-born, is according
to our passage laid on the Levites to a certain extent.
Not entirely indeed. The whole congregation is still
consecrated and must be holy. All are bound by the
covenant. The head of each family group will still
have to officiate as a priest in celebrating the passover.
Certain duties, however, are transferred for the better
protection of the sanctities of worship.</p>

<p>The first-born are found to exceed the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the Levites by two hundred and seventy-three; and
for their redemption Moses takes "five shekels apiece
by the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary." The
money thus collected is given unto Aaron and his
sons.</p>

<p>The method of redemption here presented, purely
arbitrary in respect of the sum appointed for the ransom
of each life, is fitly contrasted by the Apostle Peter
with that of the Christian dispensation. He adopts the
word <i>redeem</i>, taking it over from the old economy, but
says, "Ye were redeemed not with corruptible things,
with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life
handed down from your fathers." And the difference
is not only that the Christian is redeemed with the
precious blood of Christ, but this also, that, while the
first-born Israelite was relieved of certain parts of
the holy service which might have been claimed of him
by Jehovah, it is for sacred service, "to be a holy
priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices," Christians
are redeemed. In the one case exemption, in the other
case consecration is the end. The difference is indeed
great, and shows how much the two covenants are
in contrast with each other. It is not to enable us to
escape any of the duties or obligations of life Christ
has given Himself for us. It is to make us fit for those
duties, to bring us fully under those obligations, to
purify us that we may serve God with our bodies and
spirits which are His.</p>

<p>A passage in Exodus (xiii. 11 f.) must not be overlooked
in connection with that presently under consideration.
The enactment there is to the effect that
when Israel is brought into the land of the Canaanites
every first-born of beasts shall be set apart unto the
Lord, the firstling of an ass shall be redeemed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
lamb or killed, and all first-born children shall be
redeemed. Here the singular point is that the law is
deferred, and does not come into operation till the
settlement in Canaan. Either this was set aside for
the provisions made in Numbers, or these are to be
interpreted by it. The difficulties of the former view
are greatly increased by the mention of the "shekel of
the sanctuary," which seems to imply a settled medium
of exchange, hardly possible in the wilderness.</p>

<p>In Numb. viii. 18, 19, the subject of redemption is
again touched, and the additions are significant. Now
the service of the Levites "in the tent of meeting" is
by way of atonement for the children of Israel, "that
there be no plague among the children of Israel when
the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary."
Atonement is not with blood in this case, but by the
service of the living substitute. While the general
scope of the Mosaic law requires the shedding of blood
in order that the claim of God may be met, this exception
must not be forgotten. And in a sense it is the chief
instance of atonement, far transcending in expressiveness
those in which animals were slaughtered for
propitiation. The whole congregation, threatened with
plagues and disasters in approaching God, has protection
through the holy service of the Levitical tribe.
Here is substitution of a kind which makes a striking
point in the symbolism of the Old Testament in its
relation to the New. The principle may be seen in
patriarchal history. The ten in Sodom, if ten righteous
men could have been found, would have saved it,
would have been its atonement in a sense, not by their
death on its behalf but by their life. And Moses
himself, standing alone between God and Israel, prevails
by his pleading and saves the nation from its doom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
So our Lord says of His disciples, "Ye are the salt of
the earth." Their holy devotion preserves the mass
from moral corruption and spiritual death. Again,
"for the elect's sake," the days of tribulation shall
be shortened (Matt. xxiv. 22).</p>

<p>The ceremonies appointed for the cleansing and
consecration of the Levites, described in viii. 5-26,
may be noticed here. They differed considerably from
those enjoined for the consecration of priests. Neither
were the Levites anointed with sacred oil, for instance,
nor were they sprinkled with the blood of sacrifices;
nor, again, do they seem to have worn any special
dress, even in the tabernacle court. There was, however,
an impressive ritual which would produce in
their minds a consciousness of separation and devotion
to God. The water of expiation, literally of <i>sin</i>, was
first to be sprinkled upon them, a baptism not signifying
anything like regeneration, but having reference to
possible defilements of the flesh. A razor was then
to be made to pass over the whole body, and the clothes
were to be washed, also to remove actual as well as
legal impurity. This cleansing completed, the sacrifices
followed. One bullock for a burnt offering, with its
accompanying meal offering, and one for a sin offering
were provided. The people being assembled towards
the door of the tent of meeting, the Levites were placed
in front of them to be presented to Jehovah. The
princes probably laid their hands on the Levites, so
declaring them the representatives of all for their
special office. Then Aaron had to offer the sacrifices
for the Levites, and the Levites themselves as living
sacrifices to Jehovah. The Levites laid their hands on
the bullocks, making them their substitutes for the
symbolic purpose. Aaron and his sons slew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
animals and offered them in the appointed way, burning
the one bullock upon the altar, around which its
blood had been sprinkled, of the other burning only
certain portions called the fat. Then the ceremony
of waving was performed, or what was possible in
the circumstances, each Levite being passed through
the hands of Aaron or one of his sons. So set apart,
they were, according to viii. 24, required to wait upon
the work of the tent of meeting, each from his twenty-fifth
to his fiftieth year. The service had been previously
ordered to begin at the thirtieth year (iv. 3).
Afterwards the time of ministry was still further
extended (1 Chron. xxiii. 24-27).</p>

<p>Such is the account of the symbolic cleansing and
the representative ministry of the Levites; and we see
both a parallel and a contrast to what is demanded
now for the Christian life of obedience and devotion
to God. Purification there must be from all defilement
of flesh and spirit. With the change which takes place
when by repentance and faith in Christ we enter into
the free service of God there must be a definite and
earnest purging of the whole nature. "As ye presented
your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity
unto iniquity, even so now present your members as
servants to righteousness unto sanctification" (Rom.
vi. 19). "Mortify therefore your members which are
upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil
desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry, ...
put ye also away all these: anger, wrath, malice,
railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth: lie not
one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old
man with his doings, and have put on the new man"
(Col. iii. 5, 8, 9). Thus the purity of heart and soul so
imperfectly represented by the cleansings of the Levites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
is set forth as the indispensable preparation of the
Christian. And the contrast lies in this, that the purification
required by the New Testament law is for all,
and is the same for each. Whether one is to serve in
the ministry of the Gospel or sweep a room as for
God's cause, the same profound purity is needful. All
in the Kingdom of God are to be holy, for He is holy.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Levitical Service</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> iii. 14-39; iv</h4>

<p>The sacred service of the Levites is described in
detail. There are three divisions, the Gershonites, the
Kohathites, the Merarites. The Gershonites, from a
month old and upward, number 7,500; the Kohathites,
8,600; the Merarites, 6,200. Eleazar, son of Aaron, is
prince of the princes of the Levites.</p>

<p>The office of the Kohathites is of peculiar sanctity,
next to that of Aaron and his sons. They are not
"cut off" or specially separated from among the Levites
(iv. 18); but they have duties that require great care,
and they must not venture to approach the most holy
things till preparation has been made by the priests.
The manner of that preparation is fully described.
When order has been given for the setting forward of
the camp, Aaron and his sons cover the ark of the
covenant first with the veil of the screen, then with a
covering of sealskin, and lastly with a cloth of blue;
they also insert in the rings the long staves with
which the ark is to be carried. Next the table of
shewbread is covered with a blue cloth; the dishes,
spoons, bowls, and cups are placed on the top, over
them a scarlet cloth, and above that a sealskin covering;
the staves of the table are also placed in readiness. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
candlestick and its lamps and other appurtenances are
wrapped up in like manner and put on a frame. Then
the golden altar by itself, and the vessels used in the
service of the sanctuary by themselves are covered with
blue cloth and sealskin and made ready for carriage.
Finally, the great altar is cleansed of ashes, covered up
with purple cloth and sealskin, and its staves set in
their rings. When all this is done the sons of Kohath
may advance to bear the holy things, never touching
them lest they die.</p>

<p>The question arises, why so great care is considered
necessary that none but the priests should handle the
furniture of the sanctuary. We have learned to think
that a real religion should avoid secrecy, that everything
connected with it should be done in the open
light of day. Why, then, is the shrine of Jehovah
guarded with such elaborate precaution? And the
answer is that the idea of mystery appears here as
absolutely needful, in order to maintain the solemn
feelings of the people and their sense of the holiness
of God. Not only because the Israelites were rude
and earthly, but also because the whole system was
symbolic, the holy things were kept from common
sight. In this respect the worship described in these
books of Moses resembled that of other nations of
antiquity. The Egyptian temple had its innermost
shrine where the arks of the gods were placed; and
into that most holy place with its silver soil the priests
alone went. But even Egyptian worship, with all its
mystery, did not always conceal the arks and statues
of the gods. When those gods were believed to be
favourable, the arks were carried in procession, the
images so far unveiled that they could be seen by
the people. It was entirely different in the case of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
sacred symbols and instruments of Hebrew worship,
according to the ideal of the law. And the elaborate
precautions are to be regarded as indicating the highest
tide-mark of symbolised sanctity. Jehovah was not
like Egyptian or Assyrian or Ph&#339;nician gods. These
might be represented by statues which the people
could see. But everything used in His worship must
be kept apart. The worship must be of faith; and the
ark which was the great symbol must remain always
invisible. The effect of this on the popular mind was
complex, varying with the changing circumstances of
the nation; and to trace it would be an interesting
piece of study. It may be remembered that in the
time of most ardent Judaism the want of the ark made
no difference to the veneration in which the temple was
held and the intense devotion of the people to their
religion. The ark was used as a talisman in Eli's
time; in the temple erected after the captivity there
was no ark; its place in the holy of holies was
occupied by a stone.</p>

<p>The Gershonites had as their charge the screens
and curtains of the tabernacle, or most holy place, and
the tent of meeting or holy place, also the curtains of
the court of the tabernacle. The boards, bars, pillars,
and sockets of the tabernacle and of the court were to
be entrusted to the Merarites.</p>

<p>In the whole careful ordering of the duties to be
discharged by these Levites we see a figure of the
service to be rendered to God and men in one aspect
of it. Organisation, attention to details, and subordination
of those who carry out schemes to the appointed
officials, and of all, both inferior and superior, to law&mdash;these
ideas are here fully represented. Assuming the
incapacity of many for spontaneous effort, the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
that God is not a God of confusion but of order in the
churches of the saints may be held to point to subordination
of a similar kind even under Christianity.
But the idea carried to its full limit, implies an inequality
between men which the free spirit of Christianity
will not admit. It is an honour for men to be connected
with any spiritual enterprise, even as bearers
of burdens. Those who take such a place may be
spiritual men, thoughtful men, as intelligent and earnest
as their official superiors. But the Levites, according
to the law, were to be bearers of burdens, menials of
the sanctuary from generation to generation. Here
the parallel absolutely fails. No Christian, however
cordially he may fill such a place for a time, is bound
to it in perpetuity. His way is open to the highest
duties and honours of a redeemed son of God. In a
sense Judaism even did not prevent the spiritual
advancement of any Levite, or any man. The priesthood
was practically closed, but the office of the
prophet, really higher than that of the priest, was not.
From the routine work of the priesthood men like
Jeremiah and Ezekiel were called by the Spirit of God
to speak in the name of the Highest. The word of
the Lord was put into their mouths. Elijah, who was
apparently of the tribe of Manasseh, Amos and Daniel,
who belonged to Judah, became prophets. The open
door for the men of the tribes was into this calling.
Neither in Israel nor in Christendom is priesthood
the highest religious function. The great servants of
God might well refuse it or throw aside its shackles.</p>

<h2>
IV<br /><br />

<i>DEFILEMENT AND PURGATION</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> v</h4>

<p>The separation of Israel as a people belonging to
Jehovah proceeded on ideas of holiness which
excluded from privilege many of the Hebrews themselves.
The law did not ordain that in cases of defilement
there might be immediate purification by washing
or sacrifice. So far as ceremonial uncleanness was
concerned, we may think this might have been provided
for, and moral offences alone might have involved
the offender in continued defilement. But just as
idolatry, blasphemy, and murder caused pollution which
could not be removed by sacrifice, but only by the
capital punishment of the guilty, so certain bodily
conditions and defects, and certain diseases, chiefly
leprosy and those akin to it, were held to cause a defilement
which could not be purged by any ceremony. A
high standard of bodily health and purity was required
for the priesthood; a lower standard was to be applied
to the people. And the system declaring the uncleanness
of many animals, and of the person under various
conditions, touched at countless points the life of
society. An Israelite who was unclean for one or
other of a hundred reasons could not approach the
sanctuary. He had his portion in God after a sense;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
yet for a time, it might be for life, the peculiar blessings
of holy fellowship were denied him. He could celebrate
no feast. He had no share in the great atonement.
The precautions and terms to be observed were
of such a nature that if the law had been at any time
stringently enforced a very large percentage of the
people would have been denied access to the altar.</p>

<p>It may appear a strange thing that the precept, "Ye
shall be holy; for I am holy," was affixed not only to
moral duties but with almost the same force to ceremonial
duties. We can understand this, however,
when we trace the result of the priestly ordinances.
They created religious care and feeling; and the end
was gained not so much by directing attention, as we
now do, to faults of conduct, defects of will, sins of
injustice, impurity, intemperance, and the like, but by
keeping up a scrupulous attention to matters not,
properly speaking, either moral or immoral, not ethical
as we say, which were yet declared to be of moment
in religion. The moral law did its part. But to make
the enforcement of moral statutes, many of which bore
on desire and will, the only means of urging the fear
of God, would have resulted practically in a very bare
and desultory cultus. Among a comparatively rude
people like the Israelites it would have been absurd to
institute a religion consisting of "morality touched by
emotion." For the mass of people still it is equally
hopeless. There must be ordinances of prayer, praise,
sacrament, and the duties which reach Godward through
the Church. The value of the whole ceremonial system
of the Mosaic law is clear from this point of view; and
we need not wonder in the least at the nature of many
provisions which, without grasp of the principle, we
might reckon irksome and useless. The origin of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of the statutes is apparently hygienic; others again
reach back to customs and beliefs of a very primitive
world. But they are made part of the sacred law in
order to enforce the conviction that the judgment of
God enters into the whole of life, follows men wherever
they go, decides as to their state with relation to Him
hour by hour, almost moment by moment. The ceremonial
law was a constant and strenuous lesson in
regard to the omnipresence of God, and the oversight
of human affairs by Him. It created a conscience of
God's existence, His control, His superintendence of
each life. And for a certain stage of the education
of Israel this could be achieved in no other way. The
moral and spiritual progress of a people, depending on
the recognition of the authority of One who is of purer
eyes than to behold iniquity, depends also, of necessity,
on the sense of His oversight of human life at every
point.</p>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Exclusion from the Camp</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> v. 1-4</h4>

<p>The rigidness of the law which excluded lepers from
the camp and afterwards from the cities had its
necessity in the presumed nature of their disease.
Leprosy was regarded as contagious, and practically
incurable by any medical appliances, requiring to be
kept in check by strenuous measures. Care for the
general health meant hardship to the lepers; but this
could not be avoided. From friends and home they
were sent forth to live together as best they might,
and spend what remained of life in almost hopeless
separation. The authority of Moses is attached to
the statute of exclusion, and there can be no doubt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
its great antiquity. In Leviticus there are detailed
enactments regarding the disease, some of which
contemplate its decay and provide for the restoration
to privilege of those who had been cured. The
ceremonies were complicated, and among them were
sacrifices to be offered by way of "atonement." The
leper was alienated from God, severed from the
congregation as one guilty in the eye of the law
(Lev. xiv. 12); and there can be no wonder that with
this among other facts before him the writer of the
Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the law as having
a mere "shadow of the good things to come."</p>

<p>And yet, in view of the malignant nature of the
disease and the peril it caused to the general health,
we must admit the wisdom of segregating those afflicted
with leprosy. That Israel might be a robust people
capable of its destiny, a rule like this was needful.
It anticipated our modern laws made in harmony with
advanced medical science, which require segregation or
isolation in cases of virulent disease.</p>

<p>It has been affirmed that leprosy was from the first
regarded as symbolic of moral disease, and that the
legislation was from this point of view. There is,
however, no evidence to support the theory. Indeed
the conception of moral evil would have been confused
rather than helped by any such idea. For although
evil habits taint the mind and vice ruins it as leprosy
taints and destroys the body; although the infectious
nature of sin is fitly indicated by the insidious spread
of this disease&mdash;one point in which there is no
resemblance would make the symbol dangerously
misleading. A few here and there were attacked by
leprosy, and these with their blotched disfigured
bodies were easily distinguished from the healthy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
But this was in contrast with the secret moral malady
by which all were tainted. The teaching that leprosy
is a type of sin would make, not for morality, but for
hypocrisy. The symptoms of a bad nature, like the
signs of leprosy, would be looked for and found by
every man in his neighbour, not in his own heart.
The hypocrite would be encouraged in his self-satisfaction
because he escaped the judgment of his
fellow men. But the disease of sin is endemic,
universal. The whole congregation was by reason
of that excluded from the sanctuary of God.</p>

<p>According to the idea which underlies the priest law,
leprosy did not typify sin; it meant sin. In no single
place, indeed, is this directly affirmed. Yet the belief
connecting bodily afflictions and calamities with transgressions
implied it, and the fact that guilt offerings had
to be made for the leper when he was cleansed. Again,
in the cases of Miriam, of Gehazi, and of Uzziah, the
punishment of sin was leprosy. Under the conditions
of climate which often prevailed, the germs of this
disease might rapidly be developed by excitement,
especially by the excitement of immoral rashness.
Here we may find the connection which the law
assumes between leprosy and guilt, and the origin of
the statute which made the intervention of the priests
necessary. In their poor dwellings beyond camp and
city wall the lepers lay under a double reproach. They
were not only tainted in body but appeared as sinners
above others, men on whom some divine judgment had
fallen, as the very name of their disease implied. And
not till One came who did not fear to lay His hand on
the leprous flesh, whose touch brought healing and life,
was the pressure of the moral condemnation taken
away. Of many cases of leprosy He would have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
as of the blindness He cured: "Neither did this man
sin, nor his parents."</p>

<p>Now is the law to be charged with creating a class of
social pariahs? Is there any reason for saying that in
some way the legislation should have expressed pity
rather than the rigour which appears in the passage
before us and other enactments regarding leprosy? It
would be easy to bring arguments which would seem to
prove the law defective here. But in matters of this
kind civilization and Christian culture could not be
forestalled. What was possible, what in the conditions
that existed could be carried into effect, this only was
commanded. These old enactments sprang out of the
best wisdom and religion of the age. But they do not
represent the whole of the Divine will, the Divine mercy,
even as they were contemporaneously revealed. Add
to the statutes regarding leprosy the other, "Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself," and those that
enjoined kindness to the poor and provision for their
needs, and the true tenor of the legislation will be
understood. According to these laws there were to be
no pariahs in Israel. It was a sad necessity if any
were excluded from the congregation of God's people.
The laws of brotherhood would insure for the wretched
colony outside the camp every possible consideration.
Denied access to God in festival and sacrifice, the lepers
appealed to the humane feelings of the people. With
their pathetic cry, "Unclean, unclean!" their loose
hair and rent clothes, they confessed a miserable state
that touched every heart. As time went on, the law
of segregation was interpreted liberally. Even in the
synagogues a place was set apart for the lepers. The
kindly disposition promoted by the Mosaic institutions
was shown thus, and in many other ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The lepers banished outside the camp remind us of
those who have for no wrong-doing of their own to
endure social reproach. Were sometimes good men
and women among the Hebrews, men with kind hearts,
good mothers and daughters, attacked by this disease
and compelled to betake themselves to the squalid tents
of the lepers? That decree of rigorous precaution is
outdone by the strange fact that under the providence
of God, in His world, the best have often had to
undergo opprobrium and cruelty; that Jesus Himself
was crucified as a malefactor, bore the curse of him
that "hangeth upon a tree." We see great suffering
which is not due to moral delinquency; and we see the
sting of it taken quite away. The stern ordinances of
nature have light thrown upon them from a higher
world. "Himself took our infirmities and bare our
sicknesses." For our sakes He was the object of
brutal mockery, the sufferer, the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Besides the lepers and those who had an issue, every
one who was unclean by reason of touching a dead
body was to be excluded from the camp. This provision
appears to rest on the idea that death was no
"debt of nature," but unnatural, the result of the curse
of God. Associated, however, in the statute before us
with leprosy, defilement from the dead may have been
decreed to prevent the spread of disease. Many maladies
too well known to us have an infectious character; and
those who were present at a death would be most
exposed to their influence. Pathological explanations
do not by any means account for all the kinds and
causes of defilement; but exclusion from the camp
is the special point here; and the cases may be classed
together as having a common origin. The notion that
some demon or fallen spirit was at work both in producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
leprosy and in causing death, was involved in
the customs of some barbarous tribes and entered into
the beliefs of the Egyptians and Assyrians. This
explanation, however, is too remote and alien from
Judaism to be applied to these statutes regarding
uncleanness, at least in the form they have in the
Mosaic books. The few hints surviving in them, as
where a bird was to be allowed to fly away when the
leper was pronounced clean, cannot be permitted to
fix a charge of superstition on the whole code.</p>

<p>A singular point in the statute regarding uncleanness
"by the dead" is that the word &#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; (<i>nephesh</i>) stands
apparently for the dead body. Of this some other
explanation is needed than the free transference of
meanings in Hebrew. Here and elsewhere in the
Book of Numbers (vi. 11; ix. 6, 7, 10; xix. 13), as
well as in various passages in Leviticus, defilement is
attributed to the <i>nephesh</i>. Commonly the word means
<i>soul</i> or animal life-principle. When connected with
death it corresponds to our word "ghost," as in Job xi.
20; Jer. xv. 9. Now the law was that not only those
who touched a dead body, but all present in a house
when death took place in it, were unclean. The
question occurs whether the <i>nephesh</i>, or soul escaping
at death, was believed to defile. As if in doubt here
a rabbi said, "The body and the soul may plead
successfully not guilty by charging their sinful life each
upon the other. The body may say: 'Since that
guilty soul parted with me, I have been lying in the
grave as harmless as a stone.' The soul may plead:
'Since that depraved body separated from me, I flutter
about in the air like an innocent bird.'" Is it not
possible that the <i>nephesh</i> meant the effluvium of the
dead body, the active element which, springing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
corruption, diffused uncleanness through the whole
house of death? It seems quite in harmony with
other uses of the word, and with the idea of defilement,
to interpret "was unclean by the <i>nephesh</i>," "sinned by
the <i>nephesh</i>," as technical expressions carrying this
meaning. The passage Numb. xix. 13 is peculiarly
instructive&mdash;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1490;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501; &#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&mdash;"Every
one coming in contact with the dead, with the <i>nephesh</i>
of a man who has died." To translate, "with the
corpse of a man who has died," would fix on the
language the fault of tautology. In Psalm xvii. 9
<i>nephesh</i> has the meaning of <i>deadly</i>, that is to say
<i>breathing death</i>; and the idea here points to the
meaning suggested.</p>

<p>The reason given for the banishment of the unclean
is the presence of God in the congregation&mdash;"That
they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I
dwell." All that are unhealthy, and those who have
been in contact with death, which is the result of
irremediable disease or accident, must be withdrawn
from the precincts that belong to the Holy God.
Human maladies are in contrast with the Divine health,
death is in contrast to the Divine life. Here the whole
scope of the legislation regarding defilement has its
highest range of suggestion. It was a part of moral
education to realise that God was separate from all
distortion, wasting, and decay. In glad and deathless
power He reigned in the midst of Israel. From the
living God man received life which had to be kept pure
and disciplined. Among the Egyptians it was held
to be sacrilege when the operator, in the process
preparatory to embalming, opened a human body. He
who made the incision was driven out of the room by
his assistants with abuse and violence. Quite different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
is the idea of the Mosaic law which makes the holiness
belong entirely to God, and requires of men the
preservation of the clean life He has given. Every
statute suggests that there is a tendency in the creature
to fall away from purity and become unfit for fellowship
with the Most Holy.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Atonement for Trespass</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> v. 5-10</h4>

<p>The enactment of this passage refers to the sin of
theft or any other breach of the eighth commandment
which involved trespass not only against man, but also
against God&mdash;"When a man or woman shall commit
any sin that men commit to do a trespass against the
Lord, and that soul be guilty; then shall they confess
their sin which they have done." The statute
supplements one given in Lev. vi. 1-4, omitting some
details, but adding the provision that if the person
defrauded has died, restitution shall be made to the
<i>goël</i>, and if there is no surviving relation, to the priest.
The cases specified in Leviticus are those of false
dealing in regard to a deposit or a bargain, robbery,
oppression,&mdash;probably in the way of withholding hire
from a labourer,&mdash;finding what was lost and denying it;
but in each instance false swearing is added to the
offence and constitutes it a trespass against the Lord.
Restitution to man must be made by returning the
amount and one-fifth in addition; to God by bringing
a ram without blemish, with which the priest makes
atonement.</p>

<p>In this statute the punishment does not seem severe.
But the penalty is imposed after confession when the
offence has been for some time undetected. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
ordinary law required for the theft of an ox, if the
animal had not been slaughtered, double restitution;
and if it had been slaughtered or sold, fivefold restitution.
In the case of a sheep slaughtered or sold the
restitution was to be fourfold. Confession of the
theft, according to the present statute, diminishes
the penalty.</p>

<p>Noticeable particularly is the provision for atonement,
which is nowhere else admitted in connection with a
serious breach of the moral law. Any offence against
the first four commandments was to be punished with
death; so also were murder, adultery, and certain
other crimes. It might have been expected that false
swearing by any one in regard to theft or valuables
intrusted to him would add to his guilt. Here,
however, by means of the ram of atonement even that
offence is apparently expiated. Possibly the confession
is held to mitigate the crime. Still the nature of the
statute is surprising and exceptional.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Water of Jealousy</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> v. 11-31</h4>

<p>The long and remarkable statute regarding the
water of jealousy seems to have been interposed to
prevent, by means of an ordeal, that cruel practice of
peremptory divorce which had been in vogue at some
period among the Hebrews. The position given to
woman by the old customs must have been exceedingly
low. Under polygamy a wife was in constant danger
of suspicions and accusations she had no means of
removing. The whole scope of this enactment and
the means used for deciding between the husband
and a suspected wife point to the frequency and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
general groundlessness of charges made by men in the
"hardness of their hearts," or by other women in
the hardness of theirs.</p>

<p>The ordeal to which the wife was to be subjected
was twofold. One point was the imprecation of the
Divine curse upon herself if she had been guilty. This
oath was administered in terms and with ceremonies
fitted to produce the most profound impression. She
is set "before the Lord"&mdash;probably in the court of
the sanctuary. Her hair is loose. She has the
offering of jealousy in her hand&mdash;the tenth part of an
ephah of barley-meal. The priest holds a basin of
the "water of jealousy." The terms of the curse with
its frightful consequences are not only repeated in her
hearing, but written on a scroll which is dropped into
the water. The second thing is her drinking of the
"water of jealousy," "holy water" mingled with dust
from the floor of the sanctuary, and with the terms of
the curse. The nature of the ordeal was such that
few guilty persons would have braved it. The only
thing which appears wanting is a provision for the
punishment of the man whose wife had passed the
terrible test. Since the punishment of this crime was
death, and he made the accusation without cause, his
own judgment should have followed. Here, however,
deference had to be paid to the notions of the time,
as our Lord clearly indicates. The absolute right,
the just equality between husband and wife, could not
be established. Nor indeed, with all our progress, is it
yet secured.</p>

<p>The ordeal of the water of jealousy must have saved
many an innocent life from wreck. In one sense it
was part of a system designed to maintain a high
standard of morality, and in that system it had a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
which at the time could not be filled in any other way.
The main stress lies on the oath of purgation; and to
the present day in certain ecclesiastical courts this is
in use for the purpose of bringing to an end processes
not otherwise capable of solution. It must be noted
that our marriage laws, lax as they are thought to be,
do not give to a husband anything like the power or
allow divorce with anything like the facility admitted
by the Mosaic law as some of the Rabbis interpreted
it. And this ordeal was of such a nature that if those
in use throughout Europe only a century ago or
thereby, in the trial of witches for instance, be compared
with it, we can at once see its superiority.
Those barbarous tests, not used by the vulgar alone,
but by religious men and Church authorities, made
escape from false accusation next to impossible. Here
there is absolutely nothing required which could in
any sense injure or imperil an innocent woman. She
might take her oath, see it written, and drink the water
without the least fear or hesitation. The beneficence
of the law is strongly marked along with its wisdom.
It was a wonderful provision for the time.</p>

<h2>V<br /><br />

<i>NAZIRITISM: THE BLESSING OF AARON</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> vi</h4>

<p>1. The custom of Naziritism, which tended to form
a semi-religious caste, is obscure in its origin.
The cases of Samson and Samuel imply that before
birth some were bound in terms of this vow by their
parents. In the passage before us nothing whatever is
said as to the reasons which the law recognised for the
practice of Naziritism. We may believe, however, that
it was from the first, like many votive customs, distinctly
religious. One who had been delivered from
some danger or restored to health might adopt this
method of showing his thankfulness to God. It is
impossible to connect Naziritism with any sacerdotal
duty. A man under the vow had no function, no
privilege, that in the least approached that of the priest.
Nor can we trace any parallel between the Nazirite
rule and that of the fakirs of India or the dervishes of
Egypt and Arabia, whose poverty is their mark of
consecration. There is, however, some resemblance to
the vow of the Arab pilgrim, who, on his way to the
holy place, must not cut or dress his hair, and must
abstain from bloodshed. The prophet Amos (ii. 11)
claims that God had raised up young men to be Nazirites,
and he places their influence almost on a level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
with that of the prophets as a means of blessing to the
people. We may believe, therefore, that they helped
both morality and religion; and the conditions of their
vow seem to have given them fine bodily health and
personal appearance.</p>

<p>When the Nazirite vow was undertaken for a term,
say thirty, sixty, or a hundred days, the law assumed
its religious character, prescribed the conditions to be
observed, the means of removing accidental defilement,
and the ceremonies to be performed when the period
of separation closed. Any man might devote himself
without appealing to the priest or going through any
religious rite; and in general his own conscience was
depended on to make him rigidly attentive to his vow.
There was to be no monastic association of Nazirites,
no formal watch kept over their conduct. They
mingled with others in ordinary life, and went about
their business as at other times. But the unshorn
hair distinguished them; they felt that the eye of God
as well as the eyes of men were upon them, and
walked warily under the sense of their pledge. The
discharge which had to be given by the priest was
a further check; it would have been withheld if any
charge of laxity had been made against the Nazirite.
The ceremonies of release were of a kind fitted to
attract general attention.</p>

<p>The modern pledge of abstinence bears in various
points resemblance to the Nazirite vow. We can
easily believe that indulgence in strong drink was one
of the principal sins against which Naziritism testified.
And as in ancient Israel that body of abstainers from
the fruit of the vine, honourably known as a caste,
acknowledged by the Divine law, formed a constant
check on intemperance, so the existence of a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
class among ourselves, bound to abstinence, aids most
effectually in restraining the drinking customs of the
present age. When we add to the approval of
Naziritism which is before us here the fact that
priests in the discharge of their ministry were required
to forego the use of wine, the sanction of Hebrew
legislation on its moral side may certainly be claimed
for the total abstinence pledge. No doubt the circumstances
differ greatly. Wine was the common beverage
in Palestine. It was in general so slightly intoxicating
that the use of it brought little temptation. But our
distilled liquors and fermented drinks are so strongly
alcoholic, so dangerous to health and morals, that the
argument for abstinence is now immensely greater than
it was among the Hebrews. Not only as an example
of self-restraint, but as a safeguard against constant
peril, the pledge of abstinence deservedly enjoys the
sanction of the Churches of Christ.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the pledge of the total abstainer,
like the vow of the Nazirite, carries with it a certain
moral danger. One who, having come voluntarily
under such a pledge, allows himself to break it, suffers
a serious loss of spiritual power. The abstainer, like
the Nazirite, is his own witness, his own judge. But
if his pledge has been sacredly undertaken, solemnly
made, any breach of it is an offence to conscience, a
denial of obligation to God which must react on the
will and life. It was not by using strong drink that
Samson broke his vow of Naziritism, but in a far less
serious manner&mdash;by allowing his hair to be cut off.
Still his case is an instructive parable. The Spirit of
the Lord passed from him; he became weak as other
men, the prey of his enemies. The man who has come
under the bond of total abstinence, especially in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
religious way, and breaks it, becomes weaker than
others. To confess his fault and resume his resolution
may not lift him up again. The will is less capable,
the sense of sacredness less imperative and potent.</p>

<p>It is hard to say why the peculiar defilement caused
by touching a dead body or being present at a death
is that alone on which special attention is fixed in the
Nazirite law (vi. 9 ff.). One would have expected the
other offence of using wine to be dealt with rather
than mere accidents, so to speak. We can see that
the law as it stands is one of many that must have
preceded the prophetic period. If Amos, for example,
had influenced the nature of the legislation regarding
Naziritism, it would have been in the direction of
making drunkenness rather than ceremonial uncleanness
a special point in the statutes. From beginning
to end of his prophecy he makes no distinct reference
to ceremonial defilement. But injustice, intemperance,
disaffection to Jehovah, are constantly and vehemently
denounced. Hosea, again, does refer to unclean food,
the necessity of eating which would be part of Israel's
punishment in exile. But he too, unless in this casual
reference, is a moralist&mdash;cares nothing, so far as his
language goes, for the contact with dead bodies or
any other ceremonial defilement. Judging a Nazirite,
he would certainly have regarded sobriety and purity
of life as the tests of consecration&mdash;drunkenness and
neglect of God as the sins that deserved punishment.
Hosea's condemnation of Israel is: "They have left
off to take heed to Jehovah. Whoredom and wine
and new wine take away the understanding." In
Ezekiel, whose schemes of worship and of priestly
work are declared to have been the origin of the
Priests' Code, the same tendency is to be found. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
has a passage regarding unclean foods, which assumes
the existence of statutes on the subject. But as a
legislator he is not concerned with ceremonial transgressions,
the defilement caused by dead bodies, and
the like. Take into account the whole of his prophecy,
and it will be seen that the new heart and the right
spirit are for Ezekiel the main things, and the worship
of the temple he describes is to be that of a people not
ceremonially consecrated, but spiritually pure, and so in
moral unity with God. He adopts the old forms of
worship along with the priesthood, but his desire is
to give the ritual an ethical basis and aim.</p>

<p>The statute which applies to the discharge of the
Nazirite from his rule (vi. 13-21) is exceedingly
detailed, and contains provisions which on the whole
seem fitted to deter rather than encourage the vow.
The Nazirite could not escape from obligation as he
had entered upon it, without priestly intervention and
mediation. He had to offer an oblation,&mdash;one he-lamb
of the first year for a burnt offering; one ewe-lamb
of the first year for a sin offering; and for peace
offerings a ram, with a basket of unleavened bread,
cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, unleavened wafers
anointed with oil; and meal offerings and drink
offerings. These had to be presented by the priest
in the prescribed manner. In addition to the possible
cost of repeated cleansings which might be needful
during the period of separation, the expense of those
offerings must have been to many in a humble station
almost prohibitory. We cannot help concluding that
under this law, at whatever time it prevailed, Naziritism
became the privilege of the more wealthy. Those who
took the vow under the appointed conditions must
have formed a kind of puritan aristocracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The final ceremonies included burning of the hair,
which was carefully removed at the door of the tent of
meeting. It was to be consumed in the fire under the
peace offering, the idea being that the obligation of the
vow and perhaps its sanctity had been identified with
the flowing locks. The last rite of all was similar to
that used in the consecration of priests. The sodden
shoulder of the ram, an unleavened cake, and an
unleavened wafer were to be placed on the hands of
the Nazirite, and waved for a wave offering before the
Lord&mdash;thereafter, with other parts of the sacrifice, falling
to the priest. After that the man might drink wine,
perhaps in a formal way at the close of the ceremonies.</p>

<p>To explain this elaborate ritual of discharge it has
been affirmed that the idea of the vow "culminated
in the sacrificial festival which terminated the consecration,
and in this attained to its fullest manifestation."
If this were so, ritualism was indeed predominant. To
make such the underlying thought is to declare that
the abstinence of the Nazirite from strong drink and
dainties, to which a moralist would attach most importance,
was in the eye of the law nothing compared
to the symbolic feasting with God and the sacerdotal
functions of the final ceremony. Far more readily
would we assume that the ritual of the discharge was
superfluously added to the ancient law at a time when
the hierarchy was in the zenith of its power. But, as
we have already seen, the final rites were of a kind
fitted to direct public attention to the vow, and may
have had their use chiefly in preventing any careless
profession of Naziritism, tending to bring it into
contempt.</p>

<p>One other question still demands consideration:
What was meant by the "sin offering" which had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
be presented by the Nazirite when he had unintentionally
incurred uncleanness, and the sin offering
which had to be offered at the time of his discharge&mdash;what,
in short, was the idea of sin to which this oblation
corresponded? The case of the Nazirite is peculiarly
instructive, for the point to be considered is seen here
entirely free from complications. The Nazirite does
not undertake the obligation of his vow as an acknowledgment
of wrong he has done, nor does he place
himself under any moral disadvantage by assuming it.
There is no reason why in becoming a Nazirite or
ceasing to be a Nazirite he should appear as a
transgressor; rather is he honouring God by what he
does. Suppose he has been present at a death which
has unexpectedly taken place&mdash;that involves no moral
fault by which a man's conscience should be burdened.
Deliberately to touch a dead body might, under the
law, have brought the sense of wrongdoing; but to
be casually in a defiled house could not. Yet an
atonement was necessary (vi. 11). It is expressly
said that a sin offering and a burnt offering must be
presented to "make atonement for him, for that he
sinned by reason of the dead." And again, when he
has kept the terms of his vow to the last, honouring
Jehovah by his devotion, commending morality by
his abstinence, maintaining more rigidly than other
Israelites the idea of consecration to Jehovah, he
cannot be released from his obligation till a sin offering
is made for him. There is no moral offence
to be expiated. Rather, to judge in an ordinary human
way, he has carried obedience farther than his fellow-Israelites.</p>

<p>The whole circumstances show that the sin offering
has no reference to moral pollution. The idea is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that of removing a shadow from the conscience, but
taking away a taint of the flesh, or, in certain cases,
of the mind which has become aware of some occult
injury. A clear division was made between the moral
and the immoral; and it was assumed that all Israelites
were keeping the moral commandments of the law.
Then moral persons were divided into those who were
clean and those who were unclean; and the ceremonial
law alone determined the conditions of undefiled and
acceptable life. If the law declared that a sin offering
was necessary, it meant not that there had been immorality,
but that some specified or unspecified taint
lay upon a man. No doubt there were principles
according to which the law was framed. But they
might not be apparent; and no man could claim to
have them explained. Now with regard to Naziritism,
the idea was that of a vivid and pure form of life to
which a man might attain if he would discipline
himself. And it seems to have been understood that
in returning from this to the common life of the race
an apology, so to speak, had to be made to Jehovah
and to religion. The higher range of life during the
term of separation was peculiarly sensitive to invasions
of earthly circumstance, and especially of the defilement
caused by death; and for anything of this sort there
was needed more than apology, more than trespass-offering.
The Nazirite going back to ordinary life
was regarded in more senses than one as a sinner.
The conditions of his vow had been difficult to keep,
and, presumably, had been broken. He was all the
more under the suspicion of defilement that he had undertaken
special obligations of purity. A peculiar form
of mysticism is involved here, an effort of humanity
to reach transcendental holiness. And the law seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to give up each experiment with a sigh. In the story
of Samson we have only the popular pictorial elements
of Naziritism. The statutes convey hints of deeper
thought and feeling.</p>

<p>Generally speaking the whole system of purification
enjoined by the ceremonial law, the constant succession
of cleansings and sacrifices, must have appeared to be
arbitrary. But it would be a mistake to suppose that
there was no esoteric meaning, no purpose beyond
that of keeping up the sense of religious duty and the
need of mediation. Some intangible defilement seems
to have been associated with everything mundane,
everything human. The aim was to represent sanctity
of a transcendent kind, the nature of which no words
could express, for which the shedding of blood alone
supplied a sufficiently impressive symbol.</p>


<p>2. The blessing which the priests were commissioned
to pronounce on the people (vi. 24-26) was in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Jehovah make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Jehovah lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By means of this threefold benediction the name of
Jehovah was to be put upon the children of Israel&mdash;that
is to say, their consecration to Him as His accepted
flock and their enjoyment of His covenant grace were
to be signified. In a sense the invocation of this
blessing was the highest function of the priest: he
became the channel of spiritual endowment in which
the whole nation shared.</p>

<p>It is a striking fact that the distinctive ideas conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in the three portions of the blessing&mdash;Preservation,
Enlightenment, Peace&mdash;bear a relation, by no means
fanciful, to the work of the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Spirit. First are invoked the providential care
and favour of God, as Ruler of the universe, Arbiter
among the nations, Source of creaturely life, Upholder
of human existence. Israel as a whole, and each
individual Israelite as a member of the sacred community,
should in terms of the covenant enjoy the
guardianship of the Almighty. The idea is expanded
in Psalm cxxi.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jehovah is thy keeper:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sun shall not smite thee by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor the moon by night.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Jehovah shall keep thee from all evil;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He shall keep thy soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Jehovah shall keep thy going out and thy coming in,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From this time forth and for evermore."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in almost every Psalm the theme of Divine preservation
is touched on either in thanksgiving, prayer,
or exultant hope.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The seed also of His servants shall inherit it;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And they that love His name shall dwell therein."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Often sorely pressed by the nations around, their land
made the battle-field of empires, the Hebrews could
comfort themselves with the assurance that Jehovah of
Hosts was with them, that the God of Jacob was
their refuge. And each son of Abraham had his own
portion in the blessing.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My God in whom I trust."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>The keynote of joyful confidence in the unseen King
was struck in the benediction which, pronounced by
Aaron and by the high-priests after him, associated
Israel's safety with obedience to all the laws and forms
of religion.</p>

<p>The second member of the blessing indicates under
the figure of the shining of Jehovah's face the revelation
of enlightening truth. Here are implied the
unfolding of God's character, the kindly disclosure
of His will in promise and prophecy, the opening to
the minds of men of those high and abiding laws that
govern their destiny. There is a forth-shining of the
Divine countenance which troubles and dismays the
human heart: "The face of the Lord is against them
that do evil." But here is denoted that gracious radiance
which came to its fulness in Christ. And of this
Divine shining Jacob Boehme writes: "As the sun in
the visible world ruleth over evil and good, and with its
light and power and all whatsoever itself is, is present
everywhere, and penetrates every being, and yet in its
image-like [symbolic] form doth not withdraw again
to itself with its efflux, but wholly giveth itself into
every being, and yet ever remaineth whole, and nothing
of its being goeth away therewith: thus also it is to be
understood concerning Christ's power and office which
ruleth in the inward spiritual world visibly, and in the
outward world invisibly, and throughly penetrateth the
faithful man's soul, spirit, and heart.... And as the sun
worketh through and through an herb so that the herb
becometh solar (or filled with the virtue of the sun, and
as it were so converted by the sun that it becometh
wholly of the nature of the sun): so Christ ruleth in
the resigned will in soul and body over all evil inclinations,
over Satan's introduced lust, and generateth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
man to be a new heavenly creature and wholly floweth
into him."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>For the Hebrew people that shining of the face of
God became spiritual and potent for salvation less
through the law, the priesthood, and the ritual, than
through psalm and prophecy. Of the revelation of the
law Paul says, "The ministration of death written and
engraven on stones came with glory, so that the children
of Israel could not look steadfastly upon the face of
Moses, for the glory of his face." With such holy and
awful brightness did God appear in the law, that Moses
had to cover his face from which the splendour was
reflected. But the psalmist, pressing towards the light
with fine spiritual boldness and humility, could say,
"When Thou saidst, Seek ye My face; my heart said
unto Thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek" (Psalm xxvii. 8);
and again, "Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause
Thy face to shine; and we shall be saved" (Psalm
lxxx. 7). And in an oracle of Isaiah (liv. 8), Jehovah
says, "In overflowing wrath I hid My face from thee
for a moment; but with everlasting kindness shall I
have mercy on thee."</p>

<p>In the third clause of the benediction the peace of
God, that calm of mind, conscience, and life which
accompanies salvation, is invoked. From the trouble
and sorrow and tumult of existence, from the fear of
hostile power, from evil influences seen and unseen, the
Divine hand will give salvation. It seems indeed to be
the meaning that the gracious regard of God is enough.
Are His people in affliction and anxiety? Jehovah's
look will deliver them. They will feel calmly safe as
if a shield were interposed between them and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
keen arrows of jealousy and hatred. "In covert of
Thy presence shalt Thou hide them from the plottings
of man: Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion
from the strife of tongues." Their tranquillity is described
by Isaiah: "In righteousness shalt thou be
established: thou shalt be far from oppression, for
thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not
come near thee ... no weapon that is formed against
thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall
rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.
This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and
their righteousness which is of Me, saith the Lord."</p>

<p>The peace of the human soul is not, however, entirely
provided for by the assurance of Divine protection from
hostile force. A man is not in perfect tranquillity
because he belongs to a nation or a church defended
by omnipotence. His own troubles and fears are the
main causes of unrest. And the Spirit of God, who
cleanses and renews the soul, is the true Peace-giver.
"To win true peace a man needs to feel himself directed,
pardoned, and sustained by a supreme power, to feel
himself in the right road, at the point where God would
have him to be&mdash;in order with God and the universe."
In his heart the note of harmony must be struck deep
and true, in profound reconciliation and unity with
God. With this in view the oracles of Ezekiel connect
renewal and peace. "I will put My Spirit in you, and
ye shall live ... I will make a covenant of peace with
them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them
... and I will set My sanctuary in the midst of them
for evermore."</p>

<p>The protection of God the Father, the grace and
truth of the Son, the comfort and peace of the Spirit&mdash;were
these, then, implied in Israel's religion and included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in this blessing of Aaron? Germinally, at least, they
were. The strain of unity running through the Old and
New Testaments is heard here and in the innumerable
passages that may be grouped along with the threefold
benediction. The work of Christ, as Revealer and
Saviour, did not begin when He appeared in the flesh.
As the Divine Word He spoke by every prophet and
through the priest to the silent congregations age after
age. Nor did the dispensation of the Spirit arise on
the world like a new light on that day of Pentecost
when the disciples of Christ were gathered in their
upper chamber and the tongues of fire were seen.
There were those even in the old Hebrew days on
whom the Spirit was poured from on high, with whom
"judgment dwelt in the wilderness, and righteousness
in the fruitful field: and the work of righteousness was
peace, and the effect of righteousness quietness and
assurance for ever." He who is our peace came in the
appointed time to fill with eternal meaning the old
benedictions, and set our assurance on the immovable
rock of His own sacrifice and power.</p>

<h2>VI<br /><br />

<i>SANCTUARY AND PASSOVER</i></h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Offerings of the Princes</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> vii</h4>

<p>The opening verses of the chapter seem to imply
that immediately after the erection of the tabernacle
the gifts of the princes were brought by way of
thank offering. The note of time, "on the day that
Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle,"
appears very precise. It has been made a difficulty
that, according to the narrative of Exodus, a considerable
time had elapsed since the work was finished.
But this account of the oblations of the princes, like
a good many other ancient records incorporated in the
present book, has a place given it from the desire to
include everything that seemed to belong to the time
of the wilderness. All incidents could not be arranged
in consecutive order, because, let us suppose, the Book
of Exodus to which this and others properly belonged
was already complete. Numbers is the more fragmentary
book. The expression, "on the day," must
apparently be taken in a general sense as in Gen. ii. 4:
"These are the generations of the heavens and of the
earth in the day that the Lord God made earth and
heaven." In Numb. ix. 15 the same note of time,
"on the day that the tabernacle was reared up," marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the beginning of another reminiscence or tradition.
The setting up of the tabernacle and consecration of
the altar gave occasion presumably for this manifestation
of generosity. But the offerings described could not
be provided immediately; they must have taken time to
prepare. Golden spoons of ten shekels' weight were
not to be found ready-made in the camp; nor were
the oil and fine flour to be had at a day's notice.
Of course the gifts might have been prepared in
anticipation.</p>

<p>The account of the bringing of the offerings by the
princes on twelve successive days, one Sabbath at least
included, gives the impression of a festival display.
The narrator dwells with some pride on the exhibition
of religious zeal and liberality, a fine example set to the
people by men in high position. The gifts had not
been asked by Moses; they were purely voluntary.
Considering the value of precious metals at the time,
and the poverty of the Israelites, they were handsome,
though not extravagant. It is estimated that the gold
and silver of each prince would equal in value about
seven hundred and thirty of our shillings, and so
the whole amount contributed, without regarding the
changed value of the metals, would be equivalent to
some four hundred and thirty-eight pounds sterling.
In addition there were the fine flour and oil, and the
bullocks, rams, lambs, and kids for sacrifice.</p>

<p>It is an obvious remark here that spontaneous liberality
has in the very form of the narrative the very
highest commendation. Nothing could be more fitted
to create in the minds of the people respect for the
sanctuary and the worship associated with it than this
hearty dedication of their wealth by the heads of the
tribes. As the people saw the slow processions moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
day by day from the different parts of the camp, and
joined in raising their hallelujahs of joy and praise, a
spirit of generous devotion would be kindled in many
hearts. It appears a singular agreement that each
prince of a tribe gave precisely the same as his neighbour.
But by this arrangement one was not put to
shame by the greater liberality of another. Often, as
we know, there is in giving, quite as much of human
rivalry as of holy generosity. One must not be outdone
by his neighbour, would rather surpass his neighbour.
Here all appears to be done in the brotherly
spirit.</p>

<p>Does the author of Numbers present an ideal for us
to keep in view in our dedication of riches to the service
of the Gospel? It was in full accord with the symbolic
nature of Hebrew religion that believers should enrich
the tabernacle and give its services an air of splendour.
Almost the only way for the Israelites to honour God
in harmony with their separation from others as His
people, was that of making glorious the house in which
He set His name, the whole arrangements for sacrifice
and festival and priestly ministration. In the temple
of Solomon that idea culminated which on this occasion
fixed the value and use of the princes' gifts. But
under Christianity the service of God is the service of
mankind. When the thought and labour of the disciples
of Christ are devoted to the needs of men there
is a tribute to the glory of God. "It has been said&mdash;it
is true&mdash;that a better and more honourable offering is
made to our Master in ministry to the poor, in extending
the knowledge of His name, in the practice of the
virtues by which that name is hallowed, than in material
gifts to His temple. Assuredly it is so: woe to all
who think that any other kind or manner of offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
may in any way take the place of these."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The
decoration of the house used for worship, its stateliness
and charm, are secondary to the upbuilding of that
temple of which believing men and women are the
eternal stones, for basement, pillar, and wall. In the
development of Judaism the temple with its costly
sacrifices and ministries swallowed up the means and
enthusiasm of the people. Israel recognised no duty
to the outside world. Even its prophets, because they
were not identified with the temple worship, were in
the main neglected and left to penury. It is a mistaken
use of the teaching of the Old Testament to take
across its love of splendour in sanctuary and worship,
while the spread of Christian truth abroad and among
the poor is scantily provided for.</p>

<p>But the liberality of the leaders of the tribes, and
of all who in the times of the old covenant gave
freely to the support of religion, stands before us to-day
as a noble example. In greater gratitude for a purer
faith, a larger hope, we should be more generous.
Devoting ourselves first as living sacrifices, holy and
acceptable to God, we should count it an honour to
give in proportion to our ability. One after another,
every prince, every father of a family, every servant
of the Lord, to the poorest widow, should bring a
becoming gift.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The chapter closes with a verse apparently quite
detached from the narrative as well as from what
follows, which, however, has a singular importance as
embodying the law of the oracle. "And when Moses
went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, then
he heard the Voice speaking unto him from above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
mercy-seat that was upon the ark of the testimony,
from between the two cherubim: and he spake unto
Him." At first this may seem exceedingly anthropomorphic.
It is a human voice that is heard by Moses
speaking in response to his inquiries. One is there,
in the darkness behind the veil, who converses with
the prophet as friend communicates with friend. Yet,
on reflection, it will be felt that the statement is marked
by a grave idealism and has an air of mystery befitting
the circumstances. There is no form or visible manifestation,
no angel or being in human likeness, representing
God. It is only a Voice that is heard. And
that Voice, as proceeding from above the mercy-seat
which covered the law, is a revelation of what is in
harmony with the righteousness and truth, as well as
the compassion, of the Unseen God. The separateness
of Jehovah is very strikingly suggested. Here only,
in this tent of meeting, apart from the common life of
humanity, can the one prophet-mediator receive the
sacred oracles. And the veil still separates even
Moses from the mystic Voice. Yet God is so akin
to men that He can use their words, make His message
intelligible through Moses to those who are not holy
enough to hear for themselves, but are capable of
responding in obedient faith.</p>

<p>Whatever is elsewhere said in regard to the Divine
communications that were given through Moses must be
interpreted by this general statement. The revelations
to Israel came in the silence and mystery of this place
of audience, when the leader of the people had withdrawn
from the bustle and strain of his common tasks.
He must be in the exalted mood this highest of all
offices requires. With patient, earnest soul he must
wait for the Word of God. There is nothing sudden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
no violent flash of light on the ecstatic mind. All is
calm and grave.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Candelabrum</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> viii. 1-4</h4>

<p>The seven-branched candlestick with its lamps stood
in the outer chamber of the tabernacle into which the
priests had frequently to go. When the curtain at
the entrance of the tent was drawn aside during the
day there was abundance of light in the Holy Place,
and then the lamps were not required. It may indeed
appear from Exod. xxvii. 20, that one lamp of the
seven fixed on the candelabrum was to be kept burning
by day as well as by night. Doubt, however, is thrown
on this by the command, repeated in Lev. xxiv. 1-4,
that Aaron shall order it "from evening to morning;"
and Rabbi Kimchi's statement that the "western lamp"
was always found burning cannot be accepted as conclusive.
In the wilderness, at all events, no lamp
could be kept always alight; and from 1 Sam. iii. 3
we learn that the Divine voice was heard by the child-prophet
when Eli was laid down in his place, "and
the lamp of God was not yet gone out" in the temple
where the ark of God was. The candelabrum therefore
seems to have been designed not specially as a
symbol, but for use. And here direction is given,
"When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall
give light in front of the candlestick." All were
to be so placed upon the supports that they might
shine across the Holy Place, and illuminate the altar
of incense and the table of shewbread.</p>

<p>The text goes on to state that the candlestick was
all of beaten work of gold; "unto the base thereof and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work," and
the pattern was that which Jehovah had showed Moses.
The material, the workmanship, and the form, not
particularly important in themselves, are anew referred
to because of the special sacredness belonging to all
the furniture of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>The attempt to fasten typical meanings to the seven
lights of the candelabrum, to the ornaments and position,
and especially to project those meanings into the
Christian Church, has little warrant even from the Book
of Revelation, where Christ speaks as "He that walketh
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks." There
can be no doubt, however, that symbolic references
may be found, illustrating in various ways the subjects
of revelation and the Christian life.</p>

<p>The "tent of meeting" may represent to us that
chamber or temple of reverent inquiry where the
voice of the Eternal is heard, and His glory and
holiness are realised by the seeker after God. It is
a chamber silent, solemn, and dark, curtained in such
gloom, indeed, that some have maintained there is no
revelation to be had, no glimpse of Divine life or love.
But as the morning sunshine flowed into the Holy
Place when the hangings were drawn aside, so from
the natural world light may enter the chamber in which
fellowship with God is sought. "The invisible things
of Him since the creation of the world are clearly seen,
being perceived through the things that are made, even
His everlasting power and divinity." The world is not
God, its forces are not in the true sense elemental&mdash;do
not belong to the being of the Supreme. But it bears
witness to the infinite mind, the omnipotent will it
cannot fitly represent. In the silence of the tent of
meeting, when the light of nature shines through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
door that opens to the sunrise, we realise that the inner
mystery must be in profound accord with the outer
revelation&mdash;that He who makes the light of the natural
world must be in Himself the light of the spiritual
world; that He who maintains order in the great movements
and cycles of the material universe, maintains a
like order in the changes and evolutions of the immaterial
creation.</p>

<p>Yet the light of the natural world shining thus into
the sacred chamber, while it aids the seeker after God
in no small degree, fails at a certain point. It is too
hard and glaring for the hour of most intimate communion.
By night, as it were, when the world is
veiled and silent, when the soul is shut alone in earnest
desire and thought, then it is that the highest
possibilities of intercourse with the unseen life are
realised. And then, as the seven-branched candlestick
with its lamps illuminated the Holy Place, a
radiance which belongs to the sanctuary of life must
supply the soul's need. On the curtained walls, on the
altar, on the veil whose heavy folds guard the most
holy mysteries, this light must shine. Nature does
not reveal the life of the Ever-Living, the love of the
All-Loving, the will of the All-Holy. In the conscious
life and love of the soul, created anew after the plan
and likeness of God in Christ,&mdash;here is the light. The
unseen God is the Father of our spirits. The lamps
of purified reason, Christ-born faith and love, holy
aspiration, are those which dispel the darkness on our
side the veil. The Word and the Spirit give the oil by
which those lamps are fed.</p>

<p>Must we say that with the Father, Christ also, who
once lived on earth, is in the inner chamber which our
gaze cannot penetrate? Even so. A thick curtain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
interposed between the earthly and the heavenly.
Yet while by the light which shines in his own soul the
seeker after God regards the outer chamber&mdash;its altar,
its shewbread, its walls, and canopy&mdash;his thought
passes beyond the veil. The altar is fashioned according
to a pattern and used according to a law which
God has given. It points to prayer, thanksgiving,
devotion, that have their place in human life because
facts exist out of which they arise&mdash;the beneficence,
the care, the claims of God. The table of shewbread
represents the spiritual provision made for the soul
which cannot live but by every word that cometh out
of the mouth of God. The continuity of the outer
chamber with the inner suggests the close union there
is between the living soul and the living God&mdash;and
the veil itself, though it separates, is no jealous and
impenetrable wall of division. Every sound on this
side can be heard within; and the Voice from the
mercy seat, declaring the will of the Father through
the enthroned Word, easily reaches the waiting worshipper
to guide, comfort, and instruct. By the light
of the lamps kindled in our spiritual nature the things
of God are seen; and the lamps themselves are
witnesses to God. They burn and shine by laws He
has ordained, in virtue of powers that are not fortuitous
nor of the earth. The illumination they give on this
side the veil proves clearly that within it the Parent
Light, glorious, never-fading, shines&mdash;transcendent
reason, pure and almighty will, unchanging love&mdash;the
life which animates the universe.</p>

<p>Again, the symbolism of the candlestick has an
application suggested by Rev. i. 20. Now, the outer
chamber of the tabernacle in which the lamps shine
represents the whole world of human life. The temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
is vast; it is the temple of the universe. Still the
veil exists; it separates the life of men on earth from
the life in heaven, with God. Isaiah in his oracles of
redemption spoke of a coming revolution which should
open the world to Divine light. "He will destroy in
this mountain the face of the covering that is cast over
all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations."
And the light itself, still as proceeding from a Hebrew
centre, is described in the second book of the Isaian
prophecies: "For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace,
and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her
righteousness go forth as brightness and her salvation
as a lamp that burneth. And the nations shall
see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory." But
the prediction was not fulfilled until the Hebrew merged
in the human and He came who, as the Son of Man,
is the true light which lighteth every man coming into
the world.</p>

<p>Dark was the outer chamber of the great temple
when the Light of life first shone, and the darkness
comprehended it not. When the Church was organised,
and the apostles of our Lord, bearing the gospel of
Divine grace, went through the lands, they addressed a
world still under the veil of which Isaiah spoke. But
the spiritual enlightenment of mankind proceeded; the
lamps of the candlestick, set in their places, showed
the new altar, the new table of heavenly bread, a feast
spread for all nations, and made the ignorant and
earthly aware that they stood within a temple consecrated
by the offering of Christ. St. John saw in Asia,
amid the gross darkness of its seven great cities, seven
lamp-stands with their lights, some increasing, some
waning in brightness. The sacred flame was carried
from country to country, and in every centre of population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
a lamp was kindled. There was no seven-branched
candelabrum merely, but one of a hundred, of a thousand
arms. And all drew their oil from the one sacred
source, cast more or less bravely the same Divine illumination
on the dark eye of earth.</p>

<p>True, the world had its philosophy and poetry,
using, often with no little power, the themes of natural
religion. In the outer chamber of the temple the light
of nature gleamed on the altar, on the shewbread,
on the veil. But interpretation failed, faith in the
unseen was mixed with dreams, no real knowledge was
gained of what the folds of the curtain hid&mdash;the mercy-seat,
the holy law that called for pure worship and love
of one Living and True God. And then the darkness
that fell when the Saviour hung on the cross, the darkness
of universal sin and condemnation, was made so
deeply felt that in the shadow of it the true light might
be seen, and the lamp of every church might glow, a
beacon of Divine mercy shining across the troubled
life of man. And the world has responded, will respond,
with greater comprehension and joy, as the Gospel is
proclaimed with finer spirit, embodied with greater
zeal in lives of faith and love. Christ in the truth,
Christ in the sacraments, Christ in the words and deeds
of those who compose His Church&mdash;this is the light.
The candlestick of every life, of every body of believers,
should be as of beaten gold, no base metal mixed with
that which is precious. He who fashions his character
as a Christian is to have the Divine idea before him
and re-think it; those who build the Church are to
seek its purity, strength, and grace. But still the light
must come from God, not from man, the light that
burned on the altar of the Divine sacrifice and shines
from the glorious personality of the risen Lord.</p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Passover</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> ix. 1-14<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h4>

<p>The day fixed by statute for the feast which commemorated
the deliverance from Egypt was the fourteenth
of the first month&mdash;the year beginning with the
month of the exodus. Chap. ix. opens by reiterating
this statute, already recorded in Exod. xii. and Lev.
xxiii., and proceeds to narrate the observance of the
Passover in the second year. A supplementary provision
follows which met the case of those excluded
from the feast through ceremonial uncleanness. In
one passage it is assumed that the statutes and ordinances
of the celebration are already known. The
feast proper, ordered to be kept between the two
evenings of the fourteenth day, is, however, alone
spoken of; there is no mention of the week of unleavened
bread (Exod. xii. 15; Lev. xxiii. 6), nor of
the holy convocations with which that week was to open
and close. It is almost impossible to avoid the conclusion
that the Passover in the wilderness was a simple
family festival at which every head of a household
officiated in a priestly capacity. The supplementary
Passover of this chapter was, according to the rabbis,
distinguished from the great feast by the rites lasting
only one day instead of seven, and by other variations.
There is, however, no trace of such a difference between
the one observance and the other. What was done
by the congregation on the fourteenth of Abib was
apparently to be done at the "Little Passover" of the
following month.</p>

<p>On every male Israelite old enough to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the meaning of the Passover, the observance of it was
imperative. Lest the supplementary feast should be
made an excuse for failure to keep the fourteenth day
of the first month, it is enacted (ix. 13) that he who
wilfully neglects shall be "cut off from his people."
For strangers who sojourn among the Israelites provision
is made that if they wish to keep the feast
they may do so under the regulations applied to the
Hebrews; these, of course, including the indispensable
rite of circumcision, which had to precede any observance
of a feast in honour of God. Noticeable are the
terms with which this statute concludes: "Ye shall
have one statute, both for the stranger and for him
that is born in the land." The settlement in Canaan
is assumed.</p>

<p>Regarding the Passover in the wilderness, difficulties
have been raised on the ground that a sufficient number
of lambs, males of the first year, could scarcely have
been provided, and that the sacrificing of the lambs by
Aaron and his two sons within the prescribed time
would have been impossible. The second point of
difficulty disappears if this Passover was, as we have
seen reason to believe, a family festival like that observed
on the occasion of the exodus. Again, the number of
yearling male lambs required would depend on the
number who partook of the feast. Calculations made on
the basis that one lamb sufficed for about fifteen, and
that men alone ate the Passover, leave the matter in
apparent doubt. Some fifty thousand lambs would still
be needed. Keeping by the enumeration of the Israelites
given in the muster-roll of Numbers, some writers
explain that the desert tribes might supply large
numbers of lambs, and that kids also were available.
The difficulty, however, remains, and it is one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
which point to the conclusion that the numbers given
have somehow been increased in the transcription of
the ancient records century after century.</p>

<p>The case of certain men who could not partake of
the Passover in the first month, because they were
unclean through the dead, was brought before Moses
and Aaron. The men felt it to be a great loss of
privilege, especially as the march was about to begin,
and they might not have another opportunity of observing
the feast. Who indeed could tell whether in
the first conflict it might not be his lot to fall by the
sword? "We are unclean by the <i>nephesh</i> of a man,"
they said: "wherefore are we kept back, that we may
not offer the oblation of the Lord in its appointed
season among the children of Israel?" The result of
the appeal was the new law providing that two disabilities,
and two only, should be acknowledged. The
supplementary Passover of the second month was
appointed for those unclean by the dead, and those on
a journey who found themselves too far off to reach in
time the precincts of the sanctuary. Those unclean
would be in a month presumably free from defilement;
those on a journey would probably have returned.
The concession is a note of the gracious reasonableness
that in many ways distinguished the Hebrew religion;
and the Passover observances of Jews at the present
day are based on the conviction that what is practicable
is accepted by God, though statute and form
cannot be kept.</p>

<p>The question presents itself, why keeping of the
Passover should be necessary to covenant union with
Jehovah. And the reply bears on Christian duty with
regard to the analogous sacrament of the Lord's Supper,
for it rests on the historical sanction and continuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of faith. If God was to be trusted as a Saviour by the
Hebrew, certain facts in the nation's history had to
be known, believed, and kept in clear remembrance;
otherwise no reality could be found in the covenant.
And under the new covenant the same holds good.
The historical fact of Christ's crucifixion must be
kept in view, and constantly revived by the Lord's
Supper. In either case redemption is the main idea
presented by the commemorative ordinance. The
Hebrew festival is not to be held on the anniversary
of the giving of the law; it recalls the great deliverance
connected with the death of the first-born in Egypt.
So the Christian festival points to the deliverance of
humanity through the death of Christ.</p>

<p>Remarkable is the congruity between the view of the
law presented by Paul and the fact that the great
commemorative feast of Hebraism is attached, not to
the legislation of Sinai, but to the rescue from Egyptian
bondage. The law kept the Hebrew nation in ward
(Gal. iii. 23); "it was added because of transgressions,
till the seed should come to whom the promise had
been made" (Gal. iii. 19); it "came in beside, that the
trespass might abound" (Rom. v. 20). The Hebrews
were not required to commemorate that ordinance
which laid on them a heavy burden and was found,
as time went on, to be "unto death" (Rom. vii. 10).
And, in like manner, the feast of Christianity does not
recall the nativity of our Lord, nor that agony in the
garden which showed Him in the depths of human
sorrow, but that triumphant act of His soul which
carried Him, and humanity with Him, through the
shadow of death into the free life of spiritual energy
and peace. The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is
the commemoration of a victory by which we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
enfranchised. Partaking of it in faith, we realise our
rescue from the Egypt of slavery and fear, our unity
with Christ and with one another as "an elect race,
a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's
own possession." The wilderness journey lies before
us still; but in liberty we press on as the ransomed
of the Lord.</p>

<p>Mr. Morley has said, not without reason, that "the
modern argument in favour of the supernatural origin
of the Christian religion, drawn from its suitableness
to our needs and its Divine response to our aspirations,"
is insufficient to prove it the absolute religion. "The
argument," he says, "can never carry us beyond the
relativity of religious truth."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Christians may not
assume that "their aspirations are the absolute measure
of those of humanity in every stage." To dispense
with faith in the historical facts of the life of Christ,
His claims, and the significance of His cross, to leave
these in the haze of the past as doubtful, incapable of
satisfactory proof, and to rest all on the subjective
experience which any one may reckon sufficient, is to
obliterate the covenant and destroy the unity of the
Church. Hence, as the Hebrews had their Passover,
and the observance of it gave them coherence as a people
and as a religious body, so we have the Supper. No
local centre, indeed, is appointed at which alone our
symbolic feast can be observed. Wherever a few
renew their covenant with God in proclaiming the
Lord's death till He come, there the souls of the faithful
are nourished and inspired through fellowship with
Him who brought spiritual life and liberty to our
world.</p>

<h2>VII<br /><br />

<i>THE CLOUD AND THE MARCH</i></h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Guiding Cloud</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> ix. 15-23</h4>


<p>The pillar of cloud, the ensign of Jehovah's royalty
among the Hebrews, and for us one of the most
ancient symbols of His grace, is first mentioned in the
account of the departure from Egypt. "Jehovah went
before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the
way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them
light." At the passage of the Red Sea this murky
cloud removed and came between the host of Israel
and their pursuers. In the morning watch "Jehovah
looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the
pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of
the Egyptians." On that occasion it followed or represented
"the angel of God." There is nowhere any
attempt to give a complete account of the symbol. We
read of its glory filling the inner shrine and even the
holy place. At other times it only hovers above the
western end of the tabernacle, marking the situation of
the ark. Now and again it moves from that position,
and covers the door of the tent of meeting into which
Moses has entered. The targums use the term
<i>Shechinah</i> to indicate what it was conceived to be&mdash;a
luminous cloud, the visible manifestation of the Divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
presence; and Philo speaks of the fiery appearance of
the Deity shining forth from a cloud. But these are
glosses on the original descriptions and cannot be
altogether harmonised. In one passage only (Isa. iv. 5)
do we find a reference which appears to throw any
light on the real nature of the symbol. Evidently
recalling it, the prophet says, "Jehovah will create over
the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her
assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining
of a flaming fire by night." To him the cloud is one
of smoke rising from a fire which at night sends up
tongues of flame; and the reflection of the bright fire
on the overhanging cloud resembles a canopy of
glory.</p>

<p>Ewald's view is that the smoke of the altar which
went up in a thick column, visible at a great distance
by day, ruddy with flame by night, was the origin of
the conception. There are various objections to this
theory, which the author of it himself finds difficult to
reconcile with many of the statements. At the same
time the pillar of cloud does not need to be thought of
as in any respect a more Divine symbol than others
which were associated with the tabernacle. Certainly
the ark of the covenant which Bezaleel made according
to the instructions of Moses was, far beyond anything
else, the sacred centre around which the whole of the
worship gathered, the mysterious emblem of Jehovah's
character, the guarantee of His presence with Israel.
It was from the space above the mercy-seat, as we
have seen, that the Voice proceeded, not from the pillar
of cloud. The sanctity of the ark was so great that it
was never exposed to the view of the people, nor even
of the Levites who were set apart to carry it. The
cloud, on the other hand, was seen by all, and had its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
principal function in showing where the ark was in the
camp or on the march.</p>

<p>Now assuming, in harmony with the reference in
Isaiah, that the cloud was one of smoke, some may be
disposed to think that, like the ark of the covenant, the
holiest symbol of all, this was produced by human
intervention, yet in a way not incompatible with its
sacredness, its mystery, and value as a sign of
Jehovah's presence. Where Moses was as leader, lawgiver,
prophet, mediator, there God was for this people:
what Moses did in the spirit of Divine zeal and wisdom
was done for Israel by God. Through his inspiration
the ritual and its elaborate symbolism had their origin.
And is it not possible that after the manner of the
emblem of Jehovah which appeared in the desert of
Horeb the fire and cloud were now realised? While
some may adopt this explanation, others again will
steadily believe that the appearance and movements
of the cloud were quite apart from human device or
agency.</p>

<p>Scarcely any difficulty greater than that connected
with the pillar of cloud presents itself to thoughtful
modern readers of the Pentateuch. The traditional
view, apparently involved in the narrative, is that in
this cloud and in this alone Jehovah revealed Himself
in the interval between His appearance to Jacob and,
long afterwards, to Joshua in angelic form. Many
will maintain that unless the cloud was of supernatural
origin the whole relation of the Israelites to their
Divine King must fall into shadow. Was not this one
of the miracles which made Hebrew history different
in kind from that of every other nation? Is it not one
of the revelations of the Unseen God on which we
must build if we are to have sure faith in the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Testament economy, and indeed in Christianity itself,
as of superhuman revelation? If we are not to
interpret literally what is said in Exodus&mdash;"The Lord
went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead
them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to
give them light"&mdash;shall we not practically abandon
the whole Divine element in the history of Israel's
deliverance and education? Thus the difficulty stands.</p>

<p>Yet, it may be argued, since we have now the
revelation of God in the human life of Christ and the
gospel of salvation through the ministry of men, what
need is there to doubt that, for the guidance of a people
from place to place in the wilderness, the wisdom,
foresight, and faithfulness of an inspired man were the
appointed means? It is admitted that in many things
Moses acted for Jehovah, that his mind received in
idea, and his intellectual skill expressed in verbal form,
the laws and statutes which were to maintain Israel's
relation to God as a covenant people. We follow our
Lord Himself in saying that Moses gave Israel the law.
But the legislation of the Decalogue was far more of
the nature of a disclosure of God, and had far higher
aims and issues than could be involved in the guidance
through the desert. The law was for the spiritual
nature of the Hebrews. It brought them into relation
with God as just, pure, true, the sole source of moral
life and progress. As the nucleus of the covenant it
was symbolic in a sense that fire could never be. It
may be asked, then, What need is there to doubt that
Moses had his part in this symbol which has so long
appeared, more than the other, important as a nexus
between heaven and earth? To interpret the words
"whenever the cloud was taken up from over the
tent," as meaning that it was self-moved, would imply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
that Moses, though he is called the leader, did not lead
but was led like the rest. And this would reduce his
office to a point to which no prophet's work is reduced
throughout the entire Old Testament. Was he unable
to direct the march from Moseroth to Bene-jaakan?
An inspired man, on whom, according to the will of
God, lay the whole responsibility for Israel's national
development, was he unable to determine when the
pastures in one region were exhausted and others had
to be sought? Then indeed the mediation of his genius
would be so minimised that our whole idea of him
must be changed. Especially would we have to set
aside that prediction applied to Christ: "A prophet
shall the Lord raise up unto you, from your brethren,
like unto me."</p>

<p>And further, it may be said, the pillar of cloud and
fire retains the whole of its value as a symbol when
the intervention of Moses is admitted; and this may
be proved by the analogy of other emblems. Almost
parallel to the cloud, for instance, is the serpent of
brass, which became a sign of Jehovah's healing power,
and conveyed new life to those who looked towards it
in faith. The fact that this rude image of a serpent
was made by human hands did not in the least impair
its value as an instrument of deliverance, and the
efficacy of that particular symbol was selected by Christ
as an illustration of His own redeeming energy which
was to be gained through the cross: "As Moses
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of man be lifted up." For certain occasions
and needs of a people one symbol avails; in other
circumstances there must be other signs. The smoke-cloud
was not enough when the serpents terrified the
host. Elijah in this same desert saw a flashing fire;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
but Jehovah was not in the fire. Natural symbols,
however impressive, do not avail by themselves; and
when God by His prophet says, "This cloud, this fire,
symbolise My presence," and the people believe, is it
not sufficient? The Divine Friend is assuredly there.
The symbol is not God; it represents a fact, impresses
a fact which altogether apart from the symbol would
still hold good.</p>

<p>In the course of the passage (ix. 17-23) the manner
of the guidance given by means of the cloud is carefully
detailed. Sometimes the tribes remained encamped
for many days, sometimes only from evening
to morning. "Whether it were two days, or a month,
or a year, that the cloud tarried on the tabernacle,
abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped,
and journeyed not: but when it was taken
up, they journeyed." Here is emphasised the authority
which lay in "the commandment of the Lord <i>by the
hand of Moses</i>" (ver. 23). For Israel, as for every
nation that is not lost in the desert of the centuries,
and every society that is not on the way to confusion,
there must be wise guidance and cordial submission
thereto. We are not, however, saved now, as the
Israelites were, by a great movement of society, or
even of the Church. Individually we must see the
signal of the Divine will, and march where it points the
way. And in a sense there are no rests of many days.
Each morning the cloud moves forward; each morning
we must strike our tents. Our march is in the way
of thought, of moral and spiritual progress; and if we
live in any real sense, we shall press on along that
way. The indication of duty, the guidance in thought
which we are to follow, impose a Divine obligation
none the less that they are communicated through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
instrumentality of men. For every group of travellers,
associated in worship, duty, and aim, there is some
spiritual authority pointing the direction to be followed.
As individuals we have our separate calling, our responsibility
to Christ, with which nothing is to interfere.
But the unity of Christians in the faith and work of
the kingdom of God must be kept; and for this one
like Moses is needed, or at least a consensus of judgment,
a clear expression of the corporate wisdom.
The standard must be carried forward, and where it
moves on to quiet pasturage or grim conflict the faithful
are to advance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ye armies of the living God,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">His sacramental host,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where hallowed footsteps never trod<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Take your appointed post.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Follow the cross; the ark of peace<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Accompany your path."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, we may say, the general direction runs; and in
the changing circumstances of the Church submission
is given by its members to those who hold command
at once from the Lord Himself and from His people.
But in the details of duty each must follow the guidance
of a cloud that marks his own path to his own eye.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Silver Trumpets</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> x. 1-10</h4>

<p>An air of antique simplicity is felt in the legislation
regarding the two trumpets of silver, yet we are not
in any way hindered from connecting the statute with
the idea of claiming human art for Divine service.
Instrumental music was of course rudimentary in the
wilderness; but, such as it was, Jehovah was to control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the use of it through the priests; and the developed
idea is found in the account of the dedication of the
temple of Solomon, as recorded in 2 Chron. v., where
we are told that besides the Levites, who had cymbals,
psalteries, and harps, a hundred and twenty priests
sounding with trumpets took part in the music.</p>

<p>There is no need to question the early use of these
instruments; nevertheless, the legislation in our passage
assumes the settlement in Canaan, and times when
defensive war became necessary and the observance
of the sacred feasts fell into a fixed order. The statute
is instructive as to the meaning of the formula "The
Lord spake unto Moses," and not less as to the gradual
accretion of particulars around an ancient nucleus.
We cannot set aside the sincere record, though it may
seem to make Jehovah speak on matters of small
importance. But interpretation must spring from a
right understanding of the purpose suggested to the
mind of Moses. Uses found for the trumpets in the
course of years are simply extensions of the germinal
idea of reserving for sacred use those instruments and
the art they represented. It was well that whatever
fear or exhilaration the sounding of them caused
should be controlled by those who were responsible
to God for the moral inspiration of the people.</p>

<p>According to the statute, the two trumpets, which
were of very simple make, and capable of only a few
notes, had their use first in calling assemblies. A
long peal blown on one trumpet summoned the princes
who were the heads of the thousands of Israel: a long
peal on both trumpets called the whole congregation
to the "tent of meeting." There were occasions
when these assemblies were required not for deliberation,
but to hear in detail the instructions and orders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the leader. At other times the convocations were for
prayer or thanksgiving; or, again, the people had to
hear solemn reproofs and sentences of punishment.
We may imagine that with varying sound, joyful or
mournful, the trumpets were made to convey some
indication of the purpose for which the assembly was
called.</p>

<p>A sacred obligation lay on the Israelites to obey
the summons, whether for joy or sorrow. They heard
in the trumpet-blast the very voice of God. And upon
us, bound to His service by a more solemn and gracious
covenant, rests an obligation even more commanding.
The unity of the tribes of Israel, and their fellowship
in the obedience and worship of Jehovah, could never
be of half so much importance as the unity of Christians
in declaring their faith and fulfilling their vocation.
To come together at the call of recurring opportunity,
that we may confess Christ and hear His word anew,
is essential to our spiritual life. Those who hear the
call should know its urgency and promptly respond,
lest in the midst of the holiest light there come to
be a shadow of deep darkness, the midnight gloom of
paganism and death.</p>

<p>Again, in the wilderness, the trumpets gave the
signal for striking the camp and setting out on a new
stage of the journey. Blown sharply by way of alarm,
the peals conveyed now to one, now to another part of
the host the order to advance. The movement of the
pillar of cloud, we may assume, could not be seen
everywhere, and this was another means of direction,
not only of a general kind, but with some detail.</p>

<p>Taking vv. 5, 6, along with the passage beginning
at ver. 14, we have an ideal picture of the order of
movement. One peal, sharply rung out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
trumpets, would signify that the eastern camp, embracing
the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, should
advance. Then the tabernacle was to be taken down,
and the Levites of the families of Gershon and Merari
were to set forward with the various parts of the tent
and its enclosure. Next two alarms gave the signal
to the southern camp, that of Reuben, Simeon, and
Gad. The Levites of the family of Kohath followed,
bearing the ark, the altar of incense, the great altar,
the table of shewbread, and other furniture of the
sanctuary. The third and fourth camps, of which
Ephraim and Benjamin were the heads, brought up
the rear. In these movements the trumpets would be
of much use. But it is quite clear that the real difficulty
was not to set the divisions in motion each at a
fit time. The camps were not composed only of men
under military discipline. The women and children,
the old and feeble, had to be cared for. The flocks and
herds also had to be kept in hand. We cannot suppose
that there was any orderly procession; rather was each
camp a straggling multitude, with its own delays and
interruptions.</p>

<p>And so it is in the case of every social and religious
movement. Clear enough may be the command to
advance, the trumpet of Providence, the clarion of the
Gospel. But men and women are undisciplined in
obedience and faith. They have many burdens of a
personal kind to bear, many private differences and
quarrels. How very seldom can the great Leader
find prompt response to His will, though the terms of
it are distinctly conveyed and the demand is urgent!
God makes a plan for us, opens our way, shows us our
need, proclaims the fit hours; but our unbelief and
fear and incapacity impede the march. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
through the grace of His providence, as Israel slowly
made its way across the desert and reached Canaan at
last, the Church moves, and will continue to move,
towards the holy future, the millennial age.</p>

<p>Turning now to the uses of the silver trumpets after
the settlement in Canaan, there is first that connected
with war. The people are presumed to be living peaceably
in their country; but some neighbouring power
has attacked them. The sounding of the trumpets
then is to be of the nature of a prayer to the Divine
Protector of the nation. The cry of the dependent
tribes will be gathered up, as it were, into the shrill
blast which carries the alarm to the throne of the Lord
of Hosts. To the army and to the nation assurance is
given that the old promise of Jehovah's favour remains
in force, and that the promise, claimed by the priests
according to the covenant, will be fulfilled. And this
will make the trumpet-blast exhilarating, a presage
of victory. The claim and hope of the nation rise
heavenward. The men of war stand together in faith,
and put to flight the armies of the aliens.</p>

<p>For the battles we have to fight, the conflicts of faith
with unbelief, and righteousness with aggressive iniquity,
an inspiration is needed like that conveyed to Israel in
the peal of the silver trumpets. Have we any means
of assurance resembling that which was to animate the
Hebrews when the enemy came upon them? Even
the need is often unrecognised. Many take for granted
that religion is safe, that the truth requires no valour
of theirs in maintaining it, and the Gospel of Christ no
spirited defence. The trumpet is not heard because
the duty to which all Christians are called as helpers
of the Gospel is never considered. Messages are
accepted as oracles of God only when they tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
trustful of safety and confirm them in easy enjoyment
of spiritual privilege and hope. One kind of trumpet
peal alone is liked&mdash;that which sounds an alarm to
the unconverted, and bids them prepare for the coming
of the Judge.</p>

<p>But there are for all Christians frequent calls to a
service in which they need the courage of faith and
every hope the covenant can give. At the present
time no greater mistake is possible than to sit in comfort
under the shadow of ancient forms and creeds.
We cannot realise the value of the promise given to
genuine faith unless we abandon the crumbling walls
and meet our assailants in the open ground, where we
can see them face to face, and know the spirit with
which they fight, the ensigns of their war. There is
no brave thinking now in those old shelters, no room
to use the armour of light. Christianity is one of the
free forces of human life. Its true inspiration is found
only when those who stand by it are bent on securing
and extending the liberties of men. The trumpets that
lift to heaven the prayers of the faithful and fill the
soldiers of the Cross with the hope of victory can
never be in the hands of those who claim exclusive
spiritual authority, nor will they ever again sound the
old Hebrew note. They inspire those who are generous,
who feel that the more they give the more they
are blessed, who would impart to others their own life
that God's love to the world may be known. They call
us not to defend our own privileges, but to keep the
way of salvation open to all, to prevent the Pharisee
and the unbeliever from closing against men the door
of heavenly grace.</p>

<p>Once more; in the days of gladness and solemn
feasting the trumpets were to be blown over the burnt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
offerings and peace offerings. The joy of the Passover,
the hope of the new-moon festival, especially in the
beginning of the seventh month, were to be sent up to
heaven with the sound of these instruments, not as if
Jehovah had forgotten His people and His covenant,
but for the assurance and comfort of the worshippers.
He was a Friend before whom they could rejoice, a
King whose forgiveness was abundant, who showed
mercy unto the thousands who loved Him and kept
His commandments. The music, loud, and clear, and
bold, was to carry to all who heard it the conviction
that God had been sought in the way of His holy law,
and would cause blessing to descend upon Israel.</p>

<p>We claim with gentler sounds, those of lowly prayer
and pleading, the help of the Most High. Even in the
secret chamber when the door is shut we can address
our Father, knowing that our claim will be answered
for the sake of Christ. Yet there are times when the
loud and clear hallelujahs, borne heavenward by human
voices and pealing organ, seem alone to express our
exultation. Then the instruments and methods of
modern art may be said to bind the old Hebrew times,
the ancient faith of the wilderness and of Zion, to our
own. We carry out ideas that lie at the heart of the
race; we realise that human skill, human discovery,
find their highest use and delight when they make
beautiful and inspiring the service of God.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Order of March</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> x. 11-28</h4>

<p>The difficulties connected with the order of march
prescribed in this passage have been often and fully
rehearsed. According to the enumeration given in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
chap. ii., the van of the host formed by the division
of Judah, men, women, and children, must have reached
some six hundred thousand at least. The second division,
headed by Reuben, would number five hundred
thousand. The Levites, with their wives and children,
according to the same computation would be altogether
about seventy thousand. Then came the two remaining
camps, about nine hundred thousand souls. At
the first signal six hundred thousand would have to
get into marching order and move off across the desert.
There could be no absolute separation of the fighting
men from their families and flocks, and even if there
were no narrow passes to confine the vast multitude, it
would occupy miles of road. We must not put a day's
journey at more than ten miles. The foremost groups
would therefore have reached the camping ground, let
us say, when the last ranks of the second division were
only beginning to move; and the rear would still be on
its way when night had long fallen upon the desert.
Whatever obstacles were removed for the Israelites,
the actual distance to be traversed could not be made
less; and the journey is always represented as a stern
and serious discipline. When we take into account the
innumerable hindrances which so vast a company would
certainly have to contend with, it seems impossible that
the order of march as detailed in this passage could
have been followed for two days together.</p>

<p>Suppose we receive the explanation that the numbers
have been accidentally increased in the transcription of
records. This would relieve the narrative, not only
here but at many points, of a burden it can hardly
carry. And we remember that according to the Book
of Nehemiah less than fifty thousand Jews, returning
from Babylon at the close of the captivity, reconstructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the nation, so that it soon showed considerable spirit
and energy. If the numbers as they stand in the
Pentateuch were reduced, divided by ten, as some
propose, the desert journey would appear less of a mere
marvel. It would remain one of the most striking and
important migrations known to history; it would lose
none of its religious significance. No religious idea is
affected by the numbers who receive it; nor do the
great purposes of God depend on multitudes for their
fulfilment. We can view with composure the criticism
which touches the record on its numerical side, because
we know the prophetic work of Moses and the providential
education of Israel to be incontrovertible
facts.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the order of march as
described did not continue to be kept throughout the
whole of the wilderness journey; that in point of fact
it may have been followed only so far as Kadesh.
Whether this was so or not it must be taken into
account that for the greater part of the forty years
there was absolutely no travelling; the tribes were
settled in the wilderness of Paran. The proofs are
incidental but conclusive. From a central point,
where the cloud rested (Numb. x. 12), the people spread
themselves, we may suppose, in various directions,
seeking grass for their cattle, and living for the most
part like the other inhabitants of the district. Even if
there were but three years of travelling in all, before
and after the sojourn in the neighbourhood of Kadesh,
there would be ample time for the movement from one
place to another mentioned in the records.</p>

<h2>VIII<br /><br />

<i>HOBAB THE KENITE</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> x. 29-36</h4>

<p>The Kenites, an Arab tribe belonging to the region
of Midian, and sometimes called Midianites, sometimes
Amalekites, were already in close and friendly
relation with Israel. Moses, when he went first to
Midian, had married a daughter of their chief Jethro,
and, as we learn from Exod. xviii., this patriarch, with
his daughter Zipporah and the two sons she had borne
to Moses, came to the camp of Israel at the mount of
God. The meeting was an occasion of great rejoicing;
and Jethro, as priest of his tribe, having congratulated
the Hebrews on the deliverance Jehovah had wrought
for them, "took a burnt offering and sacrifices for
God," and was joined by Moses, Aaron, and all the
elders of Israel in the sacrificial feast. A union was
thus established between Kenites and Israelites of the
most solemn and binding kind. The peoples were
sworn to continual friendship.</p>

<p>While Jethro remained in the camp his counsel was
given in regard to the manner of administering justice.
In accordance with it rulers of thousands, hundreds,
fifties, and tens were chosen, "able men, such as feared
God, men of truth, hating covetousness"; and to them
matters of minor importance were referred for judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the hard causes only being brought before Moses.
The sagacity of one long experienced in the details of
government came in to supplement the intellectual
power and the inspiration of the Hebrew leader.</p>

<p>It does not appear that any attempt was made to
attach Jethro and the whole of his tribe to the fortunes
of Israel. The small company of the Kenites could
travel far more swiftly than a great host, and, if they
desired, could easily overtake the march. Moses, we
are told, let his father-in-law depart, and he went to
his own place. But now that the long stay of the
Israelites at Sinai is over and they are about to advance
to Canaan, the visit of a portion of the Kenite tribe is
made the occasion of an appeal to their leader to cast
in his lot with the people of God. There is some
confusion in regard to the relationship of Hobab with
Jethro or Raguel. Whether Hobab was a son or
grandson of the chief cannot be made out. The word
translated father-in-law (Numb. x. 29), means a relation
by marriage. Whatever was the tie between Hobab
and Moses, it was at all events so close, and the Kenite
had so much sympathy with Israel, that it was natural
to make the appeal to him: "Come thou with us, and
we will do thee good." Himself assured of the result
of the enterprise, anticipating with enthusiasm the high
destiny of the tribes of Israel, Moses endeavours to
persuade these children of the desert to take the way
to Canaan.</p>

<p>There was a fascination in the movement of that
people who, rescued from bondage by their Heavenly
Friend, were on their journey to the land of His
promise. This fascination Hobab and his followers
appear to have felt; and Moses counted upon it. The
Kenites, used to the wandering life, accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
strike their tents any day as occasion required, no
doubt recoiled from the thought of settling even in a
fertile country, still more from dwelling in any walled
town. But the south of Canaan was practically a
wilderness, and there, keeping to a great extent their
ancestral habits, they might have had the liberty they
loved, yet kept in touch with their friends of Israel.
Some aversion from the Hebrews, who still bore
certain marks of slavery, would have to be overcome.
Yet, with the bond already established, there needed
only some understanding of the law of Jehovah, and
some hope in His promise to bring the company of
Hobab to decision.</p>

<p>And Moses had right in saying, "Come with us, and
we will do thee good; for Jehovah hath spoken good
concerning Israel." The outlook to a future was
something which the Kenites as a people had not, never
could have in their desultory life. Unprogressive, out
of the way of the great movements of humanity,
gaining nothing as generations went by, but simply
reproducing the habits and treasuring the beliefs of
their fathers, the Arab tribe might maintain itself, might
occasionally strike for righteousness in some conflict,
but otherwise had no prospect, could have no enthusiasm.
They would live their hard life, they would
enjoy freedom, they would die&mdash;such would be their
history. Compared with that poor outlook, how good
it would be to share the noble task of establishing on
the soil of Canaan a nation devoted to truth and
righteousness, in league with the living God, destined
to extend His kingdom and make His faith the
means of blessing to all. It was the great opportunity
of these nomads. As yet, indeed, there was no courage
of religion, no brightness of enthusiasm among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Israelites. But there was the ark of the covenant,
there were the sacrifices, the law; and Jehovah
Himself, always present with His people, was revealing
His will and His glory by oracle, by discipline
and deliverance.</p>

<p>Now these Kenites may be taken as representing a
class, in the present day to a certain extent attracted,
even fascinated, by the Church, who standing irresolute
are appealed to in terms like those addressed by Moses
to Hobab. They feel a certain charm, for in the wide
organisation and vast activity of the Christian Church,
quite apart from the creed on which it is based, there
are signs of vigour and purpose which contrast
favourably with endeavours directed to mere material
gain. In idea and in much of its effort the Church
is splendidly humane, and it provides interests, enjoyments,
both of an intellectual and artistic kind, in which
all can share. Not so much its universality nor its
mission of converting the world, nor its spiritual
worship, but rather the social advantages and the
culture it offers draw towards it those minds and lives.
And to them it extends, too often without avail, the
invitation to join its march.</p>

<p>Is it asked why many, partly fascinated, remain proof
against its appeals? why an increasing number prefer,
like Hobab, the liberty of the desert, their own unattached,
desultory, hopeless way of life? The answer
must partly be that, as it is, the Church does not fully
commend itself by its temper, its enthusiasm, its
sincerity and Christianity. It attracts but is unable to
command, because with all its culture of art it does not
appear beautiful, with all its claims of spirituality it is
not unworldly; because, professing to exist for the
redemption of society, its methods and standards are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
too often human rather than Divine. It is not that
the outsider shrinks from the religiousness of the
Church as overdone; rather does he detect a lack of
that very quality. He could believe in the Divine
calling and join the enterprise of the Church if he saw
it journeying steadily towards a better country, that
is a heavenly. Its earnestness would then command
him; faith would compel faith. But social status and
temporal aims are not subordinated by the members of
the Church, nor even by its leaders. And whatever is
done in the way of providing attractions for the
pleasure-loving, and schemes of a social kind, these,
so far from gaining the undecided, rather make them
less disposed to believe. More exciting enjoyments
can be found elsewhere. The Church offering pleasures
and social reconstruction is attempting to catch those
outside by what, from their point of view, must appear
to be chaff.</p>

<p>It is a question which every body of Christians has
need to ask itself&mdash;Can we honestly say to those
without, Come with us, and we will do you good?
In order that there may be certainty on this point,
should not every member of the Church be able to
testify that the faith he has gives joy and peace, that
his fellowship with God is making life pure and strong
and free? Should there not be a clear movement of
the whole body, year by year, towards finer spirituality,
broader and more generous love? The gates of
membership are in some cases opened to such only
as make very clear and ample profession. It does
not, however, appear that those already within have
always the Christian spirit corresponding to that high
profession. And yet as Moses could invite Hobab and
his company without misgiving because Jehovah was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the Friend and Guide of Israel and had spoken good
concerning her, so because Christ is the Head of the
Church, and Captain of her salvation, those outside
may well be urged to join her fellowship. If all
depended on the earnestness of our faith and the
steadfastness of our virtue we should not dare to invite
others to join the march. But it is with Christ we ask
them to unite. Imperfect in many ways, the Church is
His, exists to show His death, to proclaim His Gospel
and extend His power. In the whole range of human
knowledge and experience there is but one life that
is free, pure, hopeful, energetic in every noble sense,
and at the same time calm. In the whole range of
human existence there is but one region in which the
mind and the soul find satisfaction and enlargement,
in which men of all sorts and conditions find true
harmony. That life and that region of existence are
revealed by Christ; into them He only is the Way.
The Church, maintaining this, demonstrating this, is
to invite all who stand aloof. They who join Christ
and follow Him will come to a good land, a heavenly
heritage.</p>

<p>The first invitation given to Hobab was set aside.
"Nay," he said, "I will not go; but I will depart to
my own land and to my kindred." The old ties of
country and people were strong for him. The true
Arab loves his country passionately. The desert is
his home, the mountains are his friends. His hard
life is a life of liberty. He is strongly attached to his
tribe, which has its own traditions, its own glories.
There have been feuds, the memory of which must be
cherished. There are heirlooms that give dignity to
those who possess them. The people of the clan are
brothers and sisters. Very little of the commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
mingles with the life of the desert; so perhaps family
feeling has the more power. These influences Hobab
felt, and this besides deterred him, that if he joined
the Israelites he would be under the command of
Moses. Hobab was prospective head of his tribe,
already in partial authority at least. To obey the
word of command instead of giving it was a thing he
could not brook. No doubt the leader of Israel had
proved himself brave, resolute, wise. He was a man
of ardent soul and fitted for royal power. But Hobab
preferred the chieftainship of his own small clan to
service under Moses; and, brought to the point of
deciding, he would not agree.</p>

<p>Freedom, habit, the hopes that have become part of
life&mdash;these in like manner interpose between many
and a call which is known to be from God. There is
restraint within the circle of faith; old ideas, traditional
conceptions of life, and many personal ambitions have
to be relinquished by those who enter it. Accustomed
to that Midian where every man does according to the
bent of his own will, where life is hard but uncontrolled,
where all they have learned to care for and desire may
be found, many are unwilling to choose the way of
religion, subjection to the law of Christ, the life of
spiritual conflict and trial, however much may be gained
at once and in the eternal future. Yet the liberty of
their Midian is illusory. It is simply freedom to spend
strength in vain, to roam from place to place where all
alike are barren, to climb mountains lightning-riven,
swept by interminable storms. And the true liberty is
with Christ, who opens the prospect of the soul, and
redeems the life from evil, vanity, and fear. The
heavenward march appears to involve privation and
conflict, which men do not care to face. But is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
worldly life free from enemies, hardships, disappointments?
The choice is, for many, between a bare life
over which death triumphs, and a life moving on over
obstacles, through tribulations, to victory and glory.
The attractions of land and people, set against those of
Christian hope, have no claim. "Every one," says the
Lord, "that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters,
or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for My sake,
shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal
life."</p>

<p>Passing on, the narrative informs us that Moses
used another plea: "Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch
as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the
wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes."
Hobab did not respond to the promise of advantage to
himself; he might be moved by the hope of being
useful. Knowing that he had to deal with a man who
was proud, and in his way magnanimous, Moses wisely
used this appeal. And he used it frankly, without
pretence. Hobab might do real and valuable service
to the tribes on their march to Canaan. Accustomed
to the desert, over which he had often travelled,
acquainted with the best methods of disposing a camp
in any given position, with the quick eye and habit of
observation which the Arab life gives, Hobab would be
the very adjutant to whom Moses might commit many
details. If he joins the tribes on this footing it will be
without pretence. He professes no greater faith either
in Israel's destiny or in Jehovah's sole Godhead than
he really feels. Wishing Israel well, interested in the
great experiment, yet not bound up in it, he may give
his counsel and service heartily so far as they avail.</p>

<p>We are here introduced to another phase of the
relation between the Church and those who do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
altogether accept its creed, or acknowledge its mission
to be supernatural, Divine. Confessing unwillingness
to receive the Christian system as a whole, perhaps
openly expressing doubts of the miraculous, for example,
many in our day have still so much sympathy with the
ethics and culture of Christianity that they would
willingly associate themselves with the Church, and
render it all the service in their power. Their tastes
have led them to subjects of study and modes of self-development
not in the proper sense religious. Some
are scientific, some have literary talent, some artistic,
some financial. The question may be, whether the
Church should invite these to join her ranks in any
capacity, whether room may be made for them, tasks
assigned to them. On the one hand, would it be
dangerous to Christian faith? on the other hand, would
it involve them in self-deception? Let it be assumed
that they are men of honour and integrity, men who
aim at a high moral standard and have some belief in
the spiritual dignity man may attain. On this footing
may their help be sought and cordially accepted by the
Church?</p>

<p>We cannot say that the example of Moses should be
taken as a rule for Christians. It was one thing to invite
the co-operation with Israel for a certain specified purpose
of an Arab chief who differed somewhat in respect
of faith; it would be quite another thing to invite one
whose faith, if he has any, is only a vague theism, to
give his support to Christianity. Yet the cases are so
far parallel that the one illustrates the other. And one
point appears to be this, that the Church may show
itself at least as sympathetic as Israel. Is there but a
single note of unison between a soul and Christianity?
Let that be recognised, struck again and again till it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
is clearly heard. Our Lord rewarded the faith of a
Syroph&#339;nician woman, of a Roman centurion. His
religion cannot be injured by generosity. Attachment
to Himself personally, disposition to hear His
words and accept His morality, should be hailed as
the possible dawn of faith, not frowned upon as a
splendid sin. Every one who helps sound knowledge
helps the Church. The enthusiast for true liberty has
a point of contact with Him whose truth gives freedom.
The Church is a spiritual city with gates that stand
wide open day and night towards every region and
condition of human life, towards the north and south, the
east and west. If the wealthy are disposed to help, let
them bring their treasures; if the learned devote themselves
reverently and patiently to her literature, let
their toil be acknowledged. Science has a tribute that
should be highly valued, for it is gathered from the
works of God; and art of every kind&mdash;of the poet, the
musician, the sculptor, the painter&mdash;may assist the cause
of Divine religion. The powers men have are given
by Him who claims all as His own. The vision of
Isaiah in which he saw Tarshish and the isles, Sheba
and Seba offering gifts to the temple of God, did not
assume that the tribute was in all cases that of covenant
love. And the Church of Christ has broader human
sympathy and better right to the service of the world
than Isaiah knew. For the Church's good, and for the
good of those who may be willing in any way to aid
her work and development, all gifts should be gladly
received, and those who stand hesitating should be
invited to serve.</p>

<p>But the analogy of the invitation to Hobab involves
another point which must always be kept in view. It
is this, that the Church is not to slacken her march not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
divert her march in any degree because men not fully
in sympathy with her join the company and contribute
their service. The Kenite may cast in his lot with the
Israelites and aid them with his experience. But Moses
will not cease to lead the tribes towards Canaan, will
not delay their progress a single day for Hobab's
sake. Nor will he less earnestly claim sole Godhead
for Jehovah, and insist that every sacrifice shall be
made to Him and every life kept holy in His way,
for His service. Perhaps the Kenite faith differed
little in its elements from that which the Israelites
inherited. It may have been monotheistic; and we
know that part of the worship was by way of sacrifice
not unlike that appointed by the Mosaic law. But it
had neither the wide ethical basis nor the spiritual aim
and intensity which Moses had been the means of
imparting to Israel's religion. And from the ideas
revealed to him and embodied in the moral and ceremonial
law he could not for the sake of Hobab resile
in the least. There should be no adjustment of creed
or ritual to meet the views of the new ally. Onward
to Canaan, onward also along the lines of religious
duty and development, the tribes would hold their way
as before.</p>

<p>In modern alliances with the Church a danger is
involved, sufficiently apparent to all who regard the
state of religion. History is full of instances in which,
to one company of helpers and another, too much
has been conceded; and the march of spiritual Christianity
is still greatly impeded by the same thing.
Money contributed, by whomsoever, is held to give
the donors a right to take their place in councils of
the Church, or at least to sway decision now in one
direction, now in another. Prestige is offered with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
tacit understanding that it shall be repaid with deference.
The artist uses his skill, but not in subordination to
the ideas of spiritual religion. He assumes the right
to give them his own colour, and may even, while
professing to serve Christianity, sensualise its teaching.
Scholarship offers help, but is not content to submit
to Christ. Having been allowed to join itself with
the Church, it proceeds, not infrequently, to play the
traitor's part, assailing the faith it was invoked to serve.
Those who care more for pleasure than for religion
may within a certain range find gratification in Christian
worship; they are apt to claim more and still
more of the element that meets their taste. And those
who are bent on social reconstruction would often,
without any thought of doing wrong, divert the Church
entirely from its spiritual mission. When all these
influences are taken into account, it will be seen that
Christianity has to go its way amid perils. It must
not be unsympathetic. But those to whom its camp is
opened, instead of helping the advance, may neutralise
the whole enterprise.</p>

<p>Every Church has great need at present to consider
whether that clear spiritual aim which ought to be the
constant guide is not forgotten, at least occasionally,
for the sake of this or that alliance supposed to be
advantageous. It is difficult to find the mean, difficult
to say who serve the Church, who hinder its success.
More difficult still is it to distinguish those who are
heartily with Christianity from those who are only so
in appearance, having some nostrum of their own to
promote. Hobab may decide to go with Israel; but
the invitation he accepts, perhaps with an air of
superiority, of one conferring a favour, is really extended
to him for his good, for the saving of his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Let there be no blowing of the silver trumpets to
announce that a prince of the Kenites henceforth
journeys with Israel; they were not made for that!
Let there be no flaunting of a gay ensign over his
tent. We shall find that a day comes when the men
who stand by true religion have&mdash;perhaps through
Kenite influence&mdash;the whole congregation to face. So
it is in Churches. On the other hand, Pharisaism is
a great danger, equally tending to destroy the value
of religion; and Providence ever mingles the elements
that enter into the counsels of Christianity, challenging
the highest wisdom, courage, and charity of the
faithful.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The closing verses of chap. x. (33-6), belonging,
like the passage just considered, to the prophetic
narrative, affirm that the ark was borne from Sinai
three days' journey before the host to find a halting-place.
The reconciliation between this statement and
the order which places the ark in the centre of the
march, may be that the ideal plan was at the outset
not observed, for some sufficient reason. The absolute
sincerity of the compilers of the Book of Numbers is
shown in their placing almost side by side the two
statements without any attempt to harmonise. Both
were found in the ancient documents, and both were
set down in good faith. The scribes into whose hands
the old records came did not assume the <i>rôle</i> of critics.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every march Moses is reported
to have used the chant: "Rise up, O Jehovah, and
let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate
Thee flee before Thee." When the ark rested he
said: "Return, O Jehovah, unto the ten thousands
of the thousands of Israel." The former is the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
strain of Psalm lxviii., and its magnificent strophes
move towards the idea of that rest which Israel finds
in the protection of her God. Part of the ode returns
upon the desert journey, adding some features and
incidents omitted in the narrations of the Pentateuch&mdash;such
as the plentiful rain which refreshed the weary
tribes, the publishing by women of some Divine oracle.
But on the whole the psalm agrees with the history,
making Sinai the scene of the great revelation of God,
and indicating the guidance He gave through the
wilderness by means of the cloudy pillar. The chants
of Moses would be echoed by the people, and would
help to maintain the sense of constant relation between
the tribes and their unseen Defender.</p>

<p>Through the wilderness Israel went, not knowing
from what quarter the sudden raid of a desert people
might be made. Swiftly, silently, as if springing out
of the very sand, the Arab raiders might bear down
upon the travellers. They were assured of the
guardianship of Him whose eye never slumbered, when
they kept His way and held themselves at His command.
Here the resemblance to our case in the
journey of life is clear; and we are reminded of our
need of defence and the only terms on which we may
expect it. We may look for protection against those
who are the enemies of God. But we have no warrant
for assuming that on whatever errand we are bound
we have but to invoke the Divine arm in order to be
secure. The dreams of those who think their personal
claim on God may always be urged have no countenance
in the prayer, "Rise up, O Jehovah, and let Thine
enemies be scattered." And as Israel settling to rest
after some weary march could enjoy the sense of
Jehovah's presence only if the duties of the day had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
been patiently done, and the thought of God's will had
made peace in every tribe, and His promise had given
courage and hope&mdash;so for us, each day will close with
the Divine benediction when we have "fought a good
fight and kept the faith." Fidelity there must be; or,
if it has failed, the deep repentance that subdues
wandering desire and rebellious will, bringing the
whole of life anew into the way of lowly service.</p>

<h2>IX<br /><br />

<i>THE STRAIN OF THE DESERT JOURNEY</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xi</h4>

<p>The narrative has accompanied the march of Israel
but a short way from the mount of God to some
spot marked for an encampment by the ark of the
covenant, and already complaining has to be told of,
and the swift judgment of those who complained. The
Israelites have made a reservation in their covenant
with God, that though obedience and trust are solemnly
promised, yet leave shall be taken to murmur against
His providence. They will have God for their Protector,
they will worship Him; but let Him make their
life smooth. Much has had to be borne which they
did not anticipate; and they grumble and speak evil.</p>

<p>Generally men do not realise that their murmuring
is against God. They have no intention to accuse His
providence. It is of other men they complain, who
come in their way; of accidents, so called, for which
no one seems to be responsible; of regulations, well
enough meant, which at some point prove vexatious;
the obtuseness and carelessness of those who undertake
but do not perform. And there does seem to be a
great difference between displeasure with human agents
whose follies and failures provoke us, and discontent
with our own lot and its trials. At the same time, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
has to be kept in view, that while we carefully refrain
from criticising Providence, there may be, underlying
our complaints, a tacit opinion that the world is not
well made nor well ordered. To a certain extent the
persons who irritate us are responsible for their mistakes;
but just among those who are prone to err our
discipline has been appointed. To gird at them is as
much a revolt against the Creator as to complain
of the heat of summer or the winter cold. With our
knowledge of what the world is, of what our fellow-creatures
are, should go the perception that God rules
everywhere and stands against us when we resent
what, in His world, we have to do or to suffer. He
is against those who fail in duty also. Yet it is not
for us to be angry. Our due will not be withheld.
Even when we suffer most it is still offered, still given.
While we endeavour to remedy the evils we feel, it
must be without a thought that the order appointed
by the Great King fails us at any point.</p>

<p>The punishment of those who complained is spoken
of as swift and terrible. "The fire of the Lord burnt
among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the
camp." This judgment falls under a principle assumed
throughout the whole book, that disaster must overtake
transgressors, and conversely that death by pestilence,
earthquake, or lightning is invariably a result of sin.
For the Israelites this was one of the convictions that
maintained a sense of moral duty and of the danger
of offending God. Again and again in the wilderness,
where thunderstorms were common and plagues spread
rapidly, the impression was strongly confirmed that
the Most High observed everything that was done
against His will. The journey to Canaan brought in
this way a new experience of God to those who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
been accustomed to the equable conditions of climate
and the comparative health enjoyed in Egypt. The
moral education of the people advanced by the quickening
of conscience in regard to all that befell Israel.</p>

<p>From the disaster at Taberah the narrative passes
to another phase of complaint in which the whole camp
was involved. The dissatisfaction began amongst the
"mixed multitude"&mdash;that somewhat lawless crowd of
low-caste Egyptians and people of the Delta and the
wilderness who attached themselves to the host.
Among them first, because they had absolutely no
interest in Israel's hope, a disposition to quarrel with
their circumstances would naturally arise. But the
spirit of dissatisfaction grew apace, and the burden of
the new complaint was: "We have nought but this
manna to look to." The part of the desert into which
the travellers had now penetrated was even more sterile
than Midian. Hitherto the food had been varied somewhat
by occasional fruits and the abundant milk of
kine and goats. But pasturage for the cattle was
scanty in the wilderness of Paran, and there were no
trees of any kind. Appetite found nothing that was
refreshing. Their soul was dried away.</p>

<p>It was a common belief in our Lord's time that the
manna, falling from heaven, very food of the angels,
had been so satisfying, so delicious, that no people
could have been more favoured than those who ate of
it. When Christ spoke of the meat which endureth
unto eternal life, the thought of His hearers immediately
turned to the manna as the special gift of God to their
fathers, and they conceived an expectation that Jesus
would give them that bread of heaven, and so prove
Himself worthy of their faith. But He replied, "Moses
gave you not that bread out of heaven, but My Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
giveth you the true bread out of heaven. I am the
Bread of Life."</p>

<p>In the course of time the manna had been, so to
speak, glorified. It appeared to the later generations
one of the most wonderful and impressive things
recorded in the whole history of their nation, this
provision made for the wandering host. There was
the water from the rock, and there was the manna.
What a benignant Providence had watched over the
tribes! How bountiful God had been to the people
in the old days! They longed for a sign of the same
kind. To enjoy it would restore their faith and put
them again in the high position which had been denied
for ages.</p>

<p>But these notions are not borne out by the history
as we have it in the passage under notice. Nothing
is said about angels' food&mdash;that is a poetical expression
which a psalmist used in his fervour. Here we read,
as to the coming of the manna, that when the dew fell
upon the camp at night the manna fell upon it, or
with it. And so far from the people being satisfied,
they complained that instead of the fish and onions,
cucumbers and melons of Egypt, they had nothing but
manna to eat. The taste of it is described as like that
of fresh oil. In Exodus it is said to have resembled
wafers mixed with honey. It was not the privilege
of the Israelites in the wilderness but their necessity
to live on this somewhat cloying food. In no sense
can it be called ideal. Nevertheless, complaining
about it, they were in serious fault, betraying the
foolish expectation that on the way to liberty they
should have no privations. And their discontent with
the manna soon became alarming to Moses. A sort
of hysteria spread through the camp. Not the women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
only, but the men at the doors of their tents bewailed
their hard lot. There was a tempest of tears and cries.</p>

<p>God, through His providence, determining for men,
carrying out His own designs for their good, does not
allow them to keep in the region of the usual and of
mere comfort. Something is brought into their life
which stirs the soul. In new hope they begin an
enterprise the course and end of which they cannot
foresee. The conventional, the pleasant, the peace and
abundance of Egypt, can be no longer enjoyed if the
soul is to have its own. By Moses Jehovah summoned
the Israelites from the land of plenty to fulfil a high
mission; and when they responded, it was so far a
proof that there was in them spirit enough for an
uncommon destiny. But for the accomplishment of it
they had to be nerved and braced by trial. Their
ordeal was that mortifying of the flesh and of sensuous
desire which must be undergone if the hopes through
which the mind becomes conscious of the will of God
are to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>In our personal history God, reaching us by His
word, enlightening us with regard to the true ends of
our being, calls us to begin a journey which has no
earthly terminus and promises no earthly reward. We
may be quite sure that we have not yet responded to
His call if there is nothing of the wilderness in our life,
no hardship, no adventure, no giving up of what is
good in a temporal sense for what is good in a spiritual
sense. The very essence of the design of God concerning
a man is that he leave the lower and seek
the higher, that he deny himself that which according
to the popular view is his life, in order to seek a
remote and lofty goal. There will be duty that calls
for faith, that needs hope and courage. In doing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
he will have recurring trials of his spirit, necessities
of self-discipline, stern difficulties of choice and action.
Every one of these he must face.</p>

<p>What is wrong with many lives is that they have
no strain in them as of a desert journey towards a
heavenly Canaan, the realisation of spiritual life. Adventure,
when it is undertaken, is often for the sake
of getting fish and melons and cucumbers by-and-by
in greater abundance and of better kinds. Many live
hardly just now, not because they are on the way to
spiritual freedom and the high destiny of life in God,
but because they believe themselves to be on the way
to better social position, to wealth or honour. But
take the life that has begun its high enterprise at the
urgency of a Divine vocation, and that life will find
hardness, deprivations, perils, of its own. It is not
given to us to be absolutely certain in decision and endeavour.
Out in the wilderness, even when manna is
provided, and the pillar of cloud seems to show the
way, the people of God are in danger of doubting
whether they have done wisely, whether they have not
taken too much upon themselves or laid too much upon
the Lord. The Israelites might have said, We have
obeyed God: why, then, should the sun smite us with
burning heat, and the dust-storms sweep down upon
our march, and the night fall with so bitter a chill?
Interminable toil, in travelling, in attending to cattle
and domestic duties, in pitching tents and striking
them, gathering fuel, searching far and wide through
the camp for food, helping the children, carrying the
sick and aged, toil that did not cease till far into the
night and had to be resumed with early morning&mdash;such,
no doubt, were the things that made life in the
wilderness irksome. And although many now have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
lighter burden, yet our social life, adding new difficulties
with every improvement, our domestic affairs,
the continual struggle necessary in labour and business,
furnish not a few causes of irritation and of bitterness.
God does not remove annoyances out of the way even
of His devoted servants. We remember how Paul
was vexed and burdened while carrying the world's
thought on into a new day. We remember what a
weight the infirmities and treacheries of men laid upon
the heart of Christ.</p>

<p>Let us thank God if we feel sometimes across the
wilderness a breeze from the hills of the heavenly
Canaan, and now and then catch glimpses of them far
away. But the manna may seem flat and tasteless,
nevertheless; the road may seem long; the sun may
scorch. Tempted to despond, we need afresh to assure
ourselves that God is faithful who has given us His
promise. And although we seem to be led not towards
the heavenly frontier, but often aside through close
defiles into some region more barren and dismal than
we have yet crossed, doubt is not for us. He knoweth
the way that we take; when He has tried us, we shall
come forth where He appoints.</p>

<p>From the people we turn to Moses and the strain he
had to bear as leader. Partly it was due to his sense
of the wrath of God against Israel. To a certain
extent he was responsible for those he led, for nothing
he had done was apart from his own will. The enterprise
was laid on him as a duty certainly; yet he
undertook it freely. Such as the Israelites were, with
that mixed multitude among them, a dangerous element
enough, Moses had personally accepted the leadership
of them. And now the murmuring, the lusting, the
childish weeping, fall upon him. He feels that he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
stand between the people and Jehovah. The behaviour
of the multitude vexes him to the soul; yet
he must take their part, and avert, if possible, their
condemnation.</p>

<p>The position is one in which a leader of men often
finds himself. Things are done which affront him personally,
yet he cannot turn against the wayward and
unbelieving, for, if he did, the cause would be lost.
The Divine judgment of the transgressors falls on him
all the more because they themselves are unaware of it.
The burden such an one has to sustain points directly
to the sin-bearing of Christ. Wounded to the soul by
the wrong-doing of men, He had to interpose between
them and the stroke of the law, the judgment of God.
And may not Moses be said to be a type of Christ?
The parallel may well be drawn; yet the imperfect
mediation of Moses fell far short of the perfect mediation
of our Lord. The narrative here reflects that partial
knowledge of the Divine character which made the mediation
of Moses human and erring for all its greatness.</p>

<p>For one thing Moses exaggerated his own responsibility.
He asked of God: "Why hast Thou evil
entreated Thy servant? Why dost Thou lay the
burden of all this people upon me? Am I their father?
Am I to carry the whole multitude as a father carries
his young child in his bosom?" These are ignorant
words, foolish words. Moses is responsible, but not
to that extent. It is fit that he should be grieved
when the Israelites do wrong, but not proper that he
should charge God with laying on him the duty of
keeping and carrying them like children. He speaks
unadvisedly with his lips.</p>

<p>Responsibility of those who endeavour to lead others
has its limits; and the range of duty is bounded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
two ways&mdash;on the one hand by the responsibility
of men for themselves, on the other hand by God's
responsibility for them, God's care of them. Moses
should see that no law or ordinance makes him chargeable
with the childish lamentations of those who know
they should not complain, who ought to be manly
and endure with stout hearts. If persons who can
go on their own feet want to be carried, no one
is responsible for carrying them. It is their own
fault when they are left behind. If those who can
think and discover duty for themselves, desire constantly
to have it pointed out to them, crave daily
encouragement in doing their duty, and complain
because they are not sufficiently considered, the leader,
like Moses, is not responsible. Every man must bear
his own burden&mdash;that is, must bear the burden of duty,
of thought, of effort, so far as his ability goes.</p>

<p>Then, on the other side, the power of God is beneath
all, His care extends over all. Moses ought not for a
moment to doubt Jehovah's mindfulness of His people.
Men who hold office in society or the Church are
never to think that their effort is commensurate with
God's. Proud indeed he would be who said: "The
care of all these souls lies on me: if they are to be
saved, I must save them; if they perish, I shall be
chargeable with their blood." Speaking ignorantly and
in haste, Moses went almost that length; but his error
is not to be repeated. The charge of the Church and
of the world is God's; and He never fails to do for all
and for each what is right. The teacher of men, the
leader of affairs, with full sympathy and indefatigable
love, is to do all he can, yet never trench on the responsibility
of men for their own life, or assume to
himself the part of Providence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>Moses made one mistake and went on to another.
He was on the whole a man of rare patience and
meekness; yet on this occasion he spoke to Jehovah
in terms of daring resentment. His cry was to get
rid of the whole enterprise: "If Thou deal thus with
me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, and let me not
see my wretchedness." He seemed to himself to have
this work to do and no other, apparently imagining that
if he was not competent for this, he could be of no use
in the world. But even if he had failed as a leader,
highest in office, he might have been fit enough for a
secondary place, under Joshua or some other whom
God might inspire: this he failed to see. And although
he was bound up in Israel's well-being, so that if the
expedition did not prosper he had no wish to live, and
was so far sincerely patriotic, yet what good end could
his death serve? The desire to die shows wounded
pride. Better live on and turn shepherd again. No
man is to despise his life, whatever it is, however it
may seem to come short of the high ambition he has
cherished as a servant of God and men. Discovering
that in one line of endeavour he cannot do all he
would, let him make trial of others, not pray for
death.</p>

<p>The narrative represents God as dealing graciously
with his erring servant. Help was provided for him
by the appointment of seventy elders, who were to
share the task of guiding and controlling the tribes.
These seventy were to have a portion of the leader's
spirit&mdash;zeal and enthusiasm like his own. Their influence
in the camp would prevent the faithlessness and
dejection which threatened to wreck the Hebrew enterprise.
Further, the murmuring of the people was to
be effectually silenced. Flesh was to be given them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
till they loathed it. They should learn that the satisfaction
of ignorant desire meant punishment rather than
pleasure.</p>

<p>The promise of flesh was speedily fulfilled by an
extraordinary flight of quails, brought up, according to
the seventy-eighth Psalm, by a wind which blew from
the south and east&mdash;that is, from the Elanitic Gulf.
These quails cannot sustain themselves long on the
wing, and after crossing the desert some thirty or forty
miles they would scarcely be able to fly. The enormous
numbers of them which fluttered around the camp are
not beyond ordinary possibility. Fowls of this kind
migrate at certain seasons in such enormous multitudes
that in the small island of Capri, near Naples,
one hundred and sixty thousand have been netted in
one season. When exhausted, they would easily be
taken as they flew at a height of about two cubits
above the ground. The whole camp was engaged in
capturing quails from one morning to the evening of
the following day; and the quantity was so great that
he who gathered least had ten homers, probably a heap
estimated to be of that measure. To keep them for
further use the birds were prepared and spread on the
ground to dry in the sun.</p>

<p>When the epidemic of weeping broke out through
the camp, the doubt occurred to Moses whether there
was any spiritual quality in the people, any fitness for
duty or destiny of a religious kind. They seemed to
be all unbelievers on whom the goodness of God and
the sacred instruction had been wasted. They were
earthly and sensual. How could they ever trust God
enough to reach Canaan?&mdash;or if they reached it, how
would their occupation of it be justified? They would
but form another heathen nation, all the worse that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
they had once known the true God and had abandoned
Him. But a different view of things was presented to
Moses when the chosen elders, men of worth, were
gathered at the tent of meeting, and on a sudden
impulse of the Spirit began to prophesy. As these
men in loud and ecstatic language proclaimed their
faith, Moses found his confidence in Jehovah's power
and in the destiny of Israel re-established. His mind
was relieved at once of the burden of responsibility
and the dread of an extinction of the heavenly light he
had been the means of kindling among the tribes. If
there were seventy men capable of receiving the Spirit
of God, there might be hundreds, even thousands. A
spring of new enthusiasm is opened, and Israel's future
is again possible.</p>

<p>Now there were two men, Eldad and Medad, who
were of the seventy, but had not come to the tent of
meeting, where the prophetic spirit fell upon the rest.
They had not heard the summons, we may suppose.
Unaware of what was taking place at the tabernacle,
yet realising the honour conferred upon them, they
were perhaps engaged in ordinary duties, or, having
found some need for their interference, they may have
been rebuking murmurers and endeavouring to restore
order among the unruly. And suddenly they also,
under the same influence as the other sixty-eight, began
to prophesy. The spirit of earnestness caught them.
With the same ecstasy they declared their faith and
praised the God of Israel.</p>

<p>There was in one sense a limitation of the spirit of
prophecy, whatever it was. Of all the host only the
seventy received it. Other good men and true in
Israel that day might have seemed as capable of the
heavenly endowment as those who prophesied. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
was, however, in harmony with a known principle that
the men designated to special office alone received the
gift. The sense of a choice felt to be that of God does
unquestionably exalt the mind and spirit of those
chosen. They realise that they stand higher and must
do more for God and men than others, that they are
inspired to say what otherwise they could not dare to
say. The limitation of the Spirit in this sense is not
invariable, is not strict. At no time in the world's
history has the call to office been indispensable to
prophetic fervour and courage. Yet the sequence is
sufficiently common to be called a law.</p>

<p>But while in a sense there is restriction of the
spiritual influence, in another sense there is no restraint.
The Divine afflatus is not confined to those who have
gathered at the tabernacle. It is not place or occasion
that makes the prophets; it is the Spirit, the power
from on high entering into life; and out in the camp
the two have their portion of the new energy and zeal.
Spiritual influence, then, is not confined to any particular
place. Neither was the neighbourhood of the tabernacle
so holy that there alone the elders could receive their
gift; nor is any place of meeting, any church, capable
of such consecration and singular identification with the
service of God that there alone the power of the Divine
Spirit can be manifested or received. Let there be
a man chosen of God, ready for the duties of a holy
calling, and on that man the Spirit will come, wherever
he is, in whatever he is engaged. He may be employed
in common work, but in doing it he will be moved
to earnest service and testimony. He may be labouring,
under great difficulties, to restore the justice that has
been impaired by social errors and political chicanery&mdash;and
his words will be prophetic; he will be a witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
for God to those who are without faith, without holy
fear.</p>

<p>While Eldad and Medad prophesied in the camp,
a young man who heard them ran officiously to inform
Moses. To this young man as to others&mdash;for no doubt
there were many who loved and revered the Usual&mdash;the
two elders were presumptuous fools. The camp
was, as we say, secular: was it not? People in the
camp looked after ordinary affairs, tended their cattle,
chaffered and bargained, quarrelled about trifles, murmured
against Moses and against God. Was it right
to prophesy there, carrying religious words and ideas
into the midst of common life? If Eldad and Medad
could prophesy, let them go to the tabernacle. And
besides, what right had they to speak for Jehovah,
in Jehovah's name? Was not Moses the prophet, the
only prophet? Israel was accustomed to think him so,
would keep to that opinion. It would be confusing if
at any one's tent door a prophet might begin to speak
without warning. So the young man thought it his
duty to run and tell Moses what was taking place.
And Joshua, when he heard, was alarmed, and desired
Moses to put an end to the irregular ministry. "My
lord Moses, forbid them," he said. He was jealous not
for himself and the other elders, but for Moses' sake.
So far the leader alone held communication with Jehovah
and spoke in His name; and there was perhaps some
reason for the alarm of Joshua, more than was apparent
at the time. To have one central authority was better
and safer than to have many persons using the right
to speak in any sense for God. Who could be sure
that these new voices would agree with Moses in every
respect? Even if they did, might there not be divisions
in the camp, new priesthoods as well as new oracles?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Prophets might not be always wise, always truly
inspired. And there might be false prophets by-and-by,
even if Eldad and Medad were not false.</p>

<p>In like manner it might be argued now that there
is danger when one here and another there assume
authority as revealers of the truth of things. Some, full
of their own wisdom, take high ground as critics and
teachers of religion. Others imagine that with the
right to wear a certain dress there has come to them
the full equipment of the prophet. And others still,
remembering how Elijah and John the Baptist arrayed
themselves in coarse cloth and leathern girdle, assume
that garb, or what corresponds to it, and claim to have
the prophetic gift because they express the voice of the
people. So in our days there is a question whether
Eldad or Medad, prophesying in the camp, ought to
be trusted or even allowed to speak. But who is
to decide? Who is to take upon him to silence the
voices? The old way was rough and ready. All who
were in office in a certain Church were commissioned
to interpret Divine mysteries; the rest were ordered
to be silent on pain of imprisonment. Those who did
not teach as the Church taught, under her direction,
were made offenders against the public well-being.
That way, however, has been found wanting, and
"liberty of prophesying" is fully allowed. With the
freedom there have come difficulties and dangers enough.
Yet to "try the spirits whether they are of God" is
our discipline on the way to life.</p>

<p>The reply of Moses to Joshua's request anticipates,
in no small degree, the doctrine of liberty. "Art thou
jealous for my sake? Would God that all the Lord's
people were prophets, and that the Lord would put
His Spirit upon them." His answer is that of a broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and magnanimous toleration. Moses cannot indeed
have believed that great religious truths were in the
reach of every man, and that any earnest soul might
receive and communicate those truths. But his conception
of a people of God is like that in the prophecy of
Joel, where he speaks of all flesh being endued with
the Spirit, the old men and young men, the sons and
daughters, alike made able to testify of what they have
seen and heard. The truly great man entertains no
jealousy of others. He delights to see in other eyes
the flash of heavenly intelligence, to find other souls
made channels of Divine revelation. He would have
no monopoly in knowledge and sacred prophecy.
Moses had instituted an exclusive priesthood; but
here he sets the gate of the prophetical office wide
open. All whom God endows are declared free in
Israel to use that office.</p>

<p>We can only wonder that still any order of men
should try in the name of the Church to shut the
mouths of those who approve themselves reverent
students of the Divine Word. At the same time let
it not be forgotten that the power of prophesying is
no chance gift, no easy faculty. He who is to speak
on God's behalf must indeed know the mind of God.
How can one claim the right to instruct others who
has never opened his mind to the Divine voice, who
has not reverently compared Scripture with Providence
and all the phases of revelation that are unfolded in
conscience and human life? Men who draw a narrow
circle and keep their thoughts within it can never
become prophets.</p>

<p>The closing verses of the chapter tell of the plague
that fell on the lustful, and the burial of those who
died of it, in a place thence called Kibroth-hattaavah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
The people had their desire, and it brought judgment
upon them. Here in Israel's history a needful warning
is written; but how many read without understanding!
And so, every day the same plague is claiming its
victims, and "graves of lust" are dug. The preacher
still finds in this portion of Scripture a subject that
never ceases to claim treatment, let social conditions be
what they may.</p>

<h2>X<br /><br />

<i>THE JEALOUSY OF MIRIAM AND AARON</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xii</h4>


<p>It may be confidently said that no representative
writer of the post-exilic age would have invented
or even cared to revive the episode of this chapter.
From the point of view of Ezra and his fellow-reformers,
it would certainly appear a blot on the character of
Moses that he passed by the women of his own people
and took a Cushite or Ethiopian wife. The idea of
the "holy seed," on which the zealous leaders of new
Judaism insisted after the return from Babylon, was
exclusive. It appeared an abomination for Israelites to
intermarry either with the original inhabitants of
Canaan, or even with Moabites, Ammonites, and Egyptians.
At an earlier date any disposition to seek
alliance with Egypt or hold intercourse with it was
denounced as profane. Isaiah and Jeremiah alike
declare that Israel, whom Jehovah led forth from
Egypt, should never think of returning to drink of its
waters or trust in its shadow. As the necessity of
separateness from other peoples became strongly felt,
revulsion from Ethiopia would be greater than from
Egypt itself. Jeremiah's inquiry, "Can the Ethiopian
change his skin?" made the dark colour of that race
a symbol of moral taint.</p>

<p>To be sure, the prophets did not all adopt this view.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Amos, especially, in one of his striking passages, claims
for the Ethiopians the same relation to God as Israel
had: "Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians
unto Me, O children of Israel, saith the Lord?" No
reproach to the Israelites is intended; they are only
reminded that all nations have the same origin and
are under the same Divine providence. And the Psalms
in their evangelical anticipations look once and again
to that dark land in the remote south: "Princes shall
come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
her hands unto God"; "I will make mention of Rahab
and Babylon to them that know Me: behold Philistia,
and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there."
The zeal of the period immediately after the captivity
carried separateness far beyond that of any earlier time,
surpassing the letter of the statute in Exod. xxxiv. 11
and Deut. vii. 2. And we may safely assert that if
the Pentateuch did not come into existence till after
the new ideas of exclusion were established, and if it
was written then for the purpose of exalting Moses and
his law, the reference to his Cushite wife would certainly
have been suppressed.</p>

<p>All the more may this be maintained when we take
into account the likelihood that it was not entirely
without reason Aaron and Miriam felt some jealousy
of the woman. The story is usually taken to mean
that there was no cause whatever for the feeling
entertained; and if Miriam alone had been involved,
we might have regarded the matter as without significance.
But Aaron had hitherto acted cordially with
the brother to whom he owed his high position. Not
a single disloyal word or deed had as yet separated
him in the least, personally, from Moses. They wrought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
together in the promulgation of law, they were together
in transgression and judgment. Aaron had every
reason for remaining faithful; and if he was now
moved to a feeling that the character and reputation
of the lawgiver were imperilled, it must have been
because he saw reason. He could approach Moses
quietly on this subject without any thought of challenging
his authority as leader. We see that while he
accompanied Miriam he kept in the background, unwilling,
himself, to appear as an accuser, though persuaded
that the unpleasant duty must be done.</p>

<p>So far as Moses is concerned these thoughts, which
naturally arise, go to support the genuineness of the
history. And in like manner the condemnation of
Aaron bears out the view that the episode is not
of legendary growth. If priestly influence had determined
to any extent the form of the narrative, the fault
of Aaron would have been suppressed. He agrees
with Miriam in making a claim the rejection of which
involves him and the priesthood in shame. And yet,
again, the theory that here we have prophetic narrative,
critical of the priesthood, will not stand; for Miriam
is a prophetess, and language is used which seems to
deny to all but Moses a clear and intimate knowledge
of the Divine will.</p>

<p>Miriam was the spokeswoman. She it was, as the
Hebrew implies, who "spake against Moses because of
the Cushite woman whom he had married." It would
seem that hitherto in right of her prophetical gift she
was to some extent an adviser of her brother, or had
otherwise a measure of influence. It appeared to her
not only a bad thing for Moses himself but absolutely
wrong that a woman of alien race, who probably came
out of Egypt with the tribes, one among the mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
multitude, should have anything to say to him in
private, or should be in his confidence. Miriam maintained,
apparently, that her brother had committed a
serious mistake in marrying this wife, and still more in
denying to Aaron and to herself that right of advising
which they had hitherto used. Was not Moses forgetting
that Miriam had her share in the zeal and
inspiration which had made the guidance of the tribes
so far successful? If Moses stands aloof, consults only
with his alien wife, will he not forfeit position and
authority and be deprived of help with which he has
no right to dispense?</p>

<p>Miriam's is an instance, the first instance we may
say, of the woman's claim to take her place side by side
with the man in the direction of affairs. It would be
absurd to say that the modern desire has its origin in
a spirit of jealousy like that which Miriam showed;
yet, parallel to her demand, "Hath the Lord indeed
spoken only by Moses? Hath he not also spoken by
us?" is the recent cry, "Has man a monopoly either
of wisdom or of the moral qualities? Are not women
at least equally endowed with ethical insight and
sagacity in counsel?" Long excluded from affairs by
custom and law, women have become weary of using
their influence in an unrecognised, indirect way, and
many would now claim an absolute parity with men,
convinced that if in any respect they are weak as
yet they will soon become capable. The claim is to
a certain extent based on the Christian doctrine of
equality between male and female, but also on the
acknowledged success of women who, engaging in public
duties side by side with men, have proved their aptitude
and won high distinction.</p>

<p>At the same time, those who have had experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of the world and the many phases of human life must
always have a position which the inexperienced may
not claim; and women, as compared with men, must
continue to be at a certain disadvantage for this reason.
It may be supposed that intuition can be placed against
experience, that the woman's quick insight may serve
her better than the man's slowly acquired knowledge.
And most will allow this, but only to a certain point.
The woman's intuition is a fact of her nature&mdash;to be
trusted often and along many ways. It is, indeed, her
experience, gained half unconsciously. But the modern
claim is assuming far more than this. We are told
that the moral sense of the race comes down through
women. They conserve the moral sense. This is no
Christian claim, or Christian only in outdoing Romanism
and setting Mary far above her Son. Seriously put
forward by women, this will throw back their whole
claim into the middle ages again. That a finer moral
sense often forms part of their intuition is admitted:
that as a sex they lead the race must be proved where,
as yet, they do not prove it. Nevertheless, the world
is advancing by the advance of women. There is no
need any longer for that jealous intriguing which has
often wrecked governments and homes. Christianity,
ruling the questions of sex, means a very stable form
of society, a continuous and calm development, the
principle of charity and mutual service.</p>

<p>Miriam claimed the position of a prophet or <i>nabi</i> for
herself, and endeavoured to make her gift and Aaron's
as revealers of truth appear equal to that of Moses.
At the Red Sea she led the chorus "Sing ye to the
Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously. The horse
and his rider hath He thrown into the sea." That,
so far as we know, was her title to count herself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
prophetess. As for Aaron, we often find his name
associated with his brother's in the formula, "The
Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron." He had also been
the <i>nabi</i> of Moses when the two went to Pharaoh with
their demand on behalf of Israel. But the claim of
equality with Moses was vain. Poor Miriam had her
one flash of high enthusiasm, and may have now and
again risen to some courage and zeal in professing her
faith. But she does not seem to have had the ability to
distinguish between her fitful glimpses of truth and
Moses' Divine intelligence. Aaron, again, must have
been half ashamed when he was placed beside his
brother. He had no genius, none of the elevation of
soul that betokens an inspired man. He obeyed well,
served the sanctuary well; he was a good priest, but
no prophet.</p>

<p>The little knowledge, the small gifts, appear great to
those who have them, so great as often to eclipse those
of nobler men. We magnify what we have,&mdash;our
power of vision, though we cannot see far; our spiritual
intelligence, though we have learned the first principles
only of Divine faith. In the religious controversies
of to-day, as in those of the past, men whose
claims are of the slightest have pushed to the front
with the demand, Hath not the Lord spoken by us?
But there is no Moses to be challenged. The age of
the revealers is gone. He who seems to be a great
prophet may be taken for one because he stands on the
past and invokes voluminous authority for all he says
and does. In truth, our disputations are between the
modern Eliphaz, Bildad, and Job&mdash;all of them to-day
men of limited view and meagre inspiration, who
repeat old hearsays with wearisome pertinacity, or
inveigh against the old interpretations with infinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
assurance. Jehovah speaks from the storm; but there
is no heed paid to His voice. By some the Word is
declared unintelligible; others deny it to be His.</p>

<p>While Moses kept silence, ruling his spirit in the
meekness of a man of God, suddenly the command
was given, "Come out, ye three, unto the tent of
meeting." Possibly the interview had been at Moses'
own tent in the near portion of the camp. Now judgment
was to be solemnly given; and the circumstances
were made the more impressive by the removal of
the cloud-pillar from above the tabernacle to the door
of the tent, where it seems to have intervened between
Moses on the one side and Miriam and Aaron on the
other; then the Voice spoke, requiring these two to
approach, and the oracle was heard. The subject of
it was the position of Moses as the interpreter of
Jehovah's will. He was distinguished from any other
prophet of the time.</p>

<p>We are here at a point where more knowledge is
needful to a full understanding of the revelation: we
can only conjecture. Not long is it since the seventy
elders belonging to different tribes were endowed with
the spirit of prophecy. Already there may have been
some abuse of their new power; for though God
bestows His gifts on men, they have practical liberty,
and may not always be wise or humble in exercising
the gifts. So the need of a distinction between Moses
and the others would be clear. As to Miriam and
Aaron, their jealousy may have been not only of Moses,
but also of the seventy. Miriam and Aaron were
prophets of older standing, and would be disposed to
claim that the Lord spoke by them rather in the way
He spoke by Moses than after the manner of His
communications through the seventy. Were members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
of the sacred family to be on a level henceforth with
any persons who spoke ecstatically in praise of
Jehovah? Thus claim asserted itself over claim. The
seventy had to be informed as to the limits of their
office, prevented from taking a place higher than they
had been assigned: Miriam and Aaron also had to be
instructed that their position differed entirely from their
brother's, that they must be content so far as prophecy
was concerned to stand with the rest whose inspiration
they may have despised. With this view the general
terms of the deliverance appear to correspond.</p>

<p>The Voice from the tent of meeting was heard
through the cloud; and on the one hand the function
of the prophet or <i>nabi</i> was defined, on the other the
high honour and prerogative of Moses were announced.
The prophet, said the Voice, shall have Jehovah made
known to him "in vision, or in dream,"&mdash;in his waking
hours, when the mind is on the alert, receiving impressions
from nature and the events of life; when
memory is occupied with the past and hope with the
future, the vision shall be given. Or again, in sleep,
when the mind is withdrawn from external objects and
appears entirely passive, a dream shall open glimpses
of the great work of Providence, the purposes of judgment
or of grace. In these ways the prophet shall
receive his knowledge; and of necessity the revelation
will be to some extent shadowed, difficult to interpret.
Now the name prophet, <i>nabi</i>, is continually applied
throughout the Old Testament, not only to the seventy
and others who like them spoke in ecstatic language, and
those who afterwards used musical instruments to help
the rapture with which the Divine utterance came, but
also to men like Amos and Isaiah. And it has been
made a question whether the inspiration of these prophets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
is to come under the general law of the oracle
we are considering. The answer in one sense is clear.
So far as the word <i>nabi</i> designates all, they are all of
one order. But it is equally certain, as Kuenen has
pointed out, that the later prophets were not always
in a state of ecstasy when they gave their oracles, nor
simply reproducing thoughts of which they first became
conscious in that state. They had an exalting consciousness
of the presence and enlightening Spirit of
Jehovah bestowed on them, or the burden of Jehovah
laid on them. The visions were often flashes of
thought; at other times the prophet seemed to look on
a new earth and heaven filled with moving symbols and
powers. But the whole development of national faith
and knowledge affected their flashes of thought and
visions, lifting prophetic energy into a higher range.</p>

<p>Now, returning to the oracle, we find that Moses is
not a prophet or <i>nabi</i> in this sense. The words that
relate to him carefully distinguish between his illumination
and that of the <i>nabi</i>. "My servant Moses is not
so; he is faithful in all Mine house: with him will I
speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly, and not in
dark speeches; and the form of Jehovah shall he
behold." Every word here is chosen to exclude the
idea of ecstasy, the idea, of vision or dream, which
leaves some shadow of uncertainty upon the mind, and
the idea of any intermediate influence between the
human intelligence and the disclosure of God's will.
And when we try to interpret this in terms of our own
mental operations, and our consciousness of the way
in which truth reaches our minds, we recognise for
one thing an impression made distinctly word by word
of the message to be conveyed. There is given to
Moses not only a general idea of the truth or principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to be embodied in his words, but he receives the very
terms. They come to him in concrete form. He has
but to repeat or write what Jehovah communicates.
Along with this there is given to Moses a power of
apprehending the form or similitude of God. His
mind is made capable of singular precision in receiving
and transmitting the oracle or statute. There
is complete calmness and what we may call self-possession
when he is in the tent of meeting face to
face with the Eternal. And yet he has this spiritual,
transcendent symbol of the Divine Majesty before him.
He is no poet, but he enjoys some revelation higher
and more exalting to mind and soul than poet ever
had.</p>

<p>The paradox is not inconceivable. There is a way
to this converse with God "mouth to mouth" along
which the patient, earnest soul can partly travel.
Without rhapsody, with full effort of the mind that has
gathered from every source and is ready for the Divine
synthesis of ideas, the Divine illumination, the Divine
dictation, if we may so speak, the humble intelligence
may arrive where, for the guidance of the personal life
at least, the very words of God are to be heard.
Beyond, along the same way, lies the chamber of
audience which Moses knew. We think it an amazing
thing to be sure of God and of His will to the very
words. Our state is so often that of doubt, or of self-absorption,
or of entanglement with the affairs of others,
that we are generally incapable of receiving the direct
message. Yet of whom should we be sure if not of
God? Of what words should we be more certain than
those pure, clear words that come from His mouth?
Moses heard on great themes, national and moral&mdash;he
heard for the ages, for the world: there lay his unique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
dignity. We may hear only for our own guidance in
the next duty that is to be done. But the Spirit of
God directs those who trust Him. It is ours to seek
and to receive the very truth.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>similitude</i> of Jehovah which
Moses saw, we notice that there is no suggestion of
human form; rather would this seem to be carefully
avoided. The statement does not take us back to the
appearance of the angel Jehovah to Abraham, nor does
it point to any manifestation like that of which we read
in the history of Joshua or of Gideon. Nothing is here
said of an angel. We are led to think of an exaltation
of the spiritual perception of Moses, so that he knew
the reality of the Divine life, and was made sure of an
originative wisdom, a transcendent source of ideas and
moral energy. He with whom Moses holds communion
is One whose might and holiness and glory are seen
with the spiritual eye, whose will is made known by
a voice entering into the soul. And the distinction
intended between Moses and all other prophets corresponds
to a fact which the history of Israel's religion
brings to light. The account of the way in which
Jehovah communicated with Moses remains subject to
the condition that the expressions used, such as "mouth
to mouth," are still only symbols of the truth. They
mean that in the very highest sense possible to man
Moses entered into the purposes of God regarding His
people. Now Isaiah certainly approached this intimate
knowledge of the Divine counsel when long afterwards
he said in Jehovah's name: "Behold My Servant, whom
I uphold; Mine Elect, in whom My soul delighteth; I
have put My Spirit upon Him: He shall bring forth
judgment unto the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor
lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Yet between Moses and Isaiah there is a difference.
For Moses is the means of giving to Israel pure morality
and true religion. By the inspiration of God he brings
into existence that which is not. Isaiah foresees;
Moses, in a sense, creates. And the one parallel with
Moses, according to Scripture, is to be found in Christ,
who is the creator of the new humanity.</p>

<p>When the oracle had spoken, there was a movement
of the cloud from the door of the tent of meeting,
and apparently from the tabernacle&mdash;a sign of the displeasure
of God. Following the idea that the cloud
was connected with the altar, this withdrawal has been
interpreted by Lange as a rebuke to Aaron. "He was
inwardly crushed; the fire on his altar went out; the
pillar of smoke no longer mounted up as a token of
grace; the cultus was for a moment at a standstill,
and it was as if an interdict of Jehovah lay on the cultus
of the sanctuary." But the cloud-pillar is not, as this
interpretation would imply, associated with Aaron personally;
it is always the symbol of the Divine will
"by the hand of Moses." We must suppose therefore
that the movement of the cloud conveyed in some new
and unexpected way a sense of the Divine support
which Moses enjoyed. He was justified in all he had
done: condemnation was brought home to his accusers.</p>

<p>And Miriam, who had offended most, was punished
with more than a rebuke. Suddenly she was found
to be covered with leprosy. Aaron, looking upon her,
saw that morbid pallor which was regarded as the
invariable sign of the disease. It was seen as a proof
of her sin and of the anger of Jehovah. Himself
trembling as one who had barely escaped, Aaron
could not but confess his share in the transgression.
Addressing Moses with the deepest reverence, he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
"Oh my lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, for
that we have done foolishly, and for that we have
sinned." The leprosy is the mark of sin. Let it not
be stamped on her indelibly, nor on me. Let not
the disease run its course to the horrible end. With
no small presumption the two had ventured to challenge
their brother's conduct and position. They knew
indeed, yet from their intimacy with him did not rightly
apprehend, the "divinity that hedged" him. Now for
the first time its terror is disclosed to themselves; and
they shrink before the man of God, pleading with him
as if he were omnipotent.</p>

<p>Moses needs no second appeal to his compassion.
He is a truly inspired man, and can forgive. He has
seen the great God merciful and gracious, longsuffering,
slow to anger, and he has caught something of the
Divine magnanimity. This temper was not always
shown throughout Israel's history by those who had
the position of prophets. And we find that men who
claim to be religious, even to be interpreters of the
Divine will, are not invariably above retaliation. They
are seen to hate those who criticise them, who throw
doubt upon their arguments. A man's claim to fellowship
with God, his professed knowledge of the Divine
truth and religion, may be tested by his conduct when
he is under challenge. If he cannot plead with God
on behalf of those who have assailed him, he has not
the Spirit; he is as "sounding brass, or a clanging
cymbal."</p>

<p>Even in response to the prayer of Moses, Miriam
could not be cured at once. She must go aside
bearing her reproach. Shame for her offence, apart
from the taint of leprosy, would make it fitting that she
should withdraw seven days from camp and sanctuary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
A personal indignity, not affecting her character in the
least, would have been felt to that extent. Her
transgression is to be realised and brooded over for
her spiritual good. The law is one that needs to be
kept in mind. To escape detection and leave adverse
judgment behind is all that some offenders against
moral law seem to desire. They dread the shame
and nothing besides. Let that be avoided, or, after
continuing for a time, let the sense of it pass, and they
feel themselves free. But true shame is towards God;
and from the mind sincerely penitent that does not
quickly pass away. Those only who are ignorant of
the nature of sin can soon overcome the consciousness
of God's displeasure. As for men, no doubt they should
forgive; but their forgiveness is often too lightly
granted, too complacently assumed, and we see the
easy self-recovery of one who should be sitting in
sackcloth and ashes. God forgives with infinite depth
of tenderness and grace of pardon. But His very
generosity will affect the truly contrite with poignant
sorrow when His name has by their act been brought
into dishonour.</p>

<p>The offence of Miriam was only jealousy and presumption.
She may scarcely seem so great a sinner
that an attack of leprosy should have been her
punishment, though it lasted for no more than seven
days. We make so much of bodily maladies, so little
of diseases of the soul, that we would think it strange
if any one for his pride should be struck with paralysis,
or for envy should be laid down with fever. Yet beside
the spiritual disorder that of the body is of small moment.
Why do we think so little of the moral taint, the falsehood,
malice, impurity, and so much of the ills our
flesh is heir to? The bad heart is the great disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Miriam's exclusion from the camp becomes a lesson
to all the people. They do not journey while she is
separated as unclean. There may have been other
lepers in the outlying tents; but her sin has been of
such a kind that the public conscience is especially
directed to it. And the lesson had particular point
with reference to those who had the prophetic gift.</p>

<p>Modern society, making much of sanitation and all
kinds of improvements and precautions intended to
prevent the spread of epidemics and mitigate their
effects, has also some thought of moral disease. Persons
guilty of certain crimes are confined in prisons or "cut
off from the people." But of the greater number of
moral maladies no account is taken. And there is no
widespread gloom over the nation, no arrest of affairs,
when some hideous case of social immorality or business
depravity has come to light. It is but a few
who pray for those who have the evil heart, and wait
sympathetically for their cleansing. Ought not the
reorganisation of society to be on a moral rather
than an economic basis? We should be nearer the
general well-being if it were reckoned a disaster when
any employer oppressed those under him, or workmen
were found indifferent to their brothers, or a
grave crime disclosed a low state of morality in some
class or circle. It is the defeat of armies and navies,
the overthrow of measures and governments, that occupy
our attention as a people, and seem often to obscure
every moral and religious thought. Or if injustice is
the topic, we find the point of it in this: that one class
is rich while another is poor; that money, not character,
is lost in shameful contention.</p>

<h2>XI<br /><br />

<i>THE SPIES AND THEIR REPORT</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xiii.; xiv. 1-10</h4>

<p>Two narratives at least appear to be united in the
thirteenth and fourteenth chapters. From xiii.
17, 22, 23, we learn that the spies were despatched
by way of the south, and that they went to Hebron
and a little beyond, as far as the valley of Eshcol.
But ver. 21 states that they spied out the land from
the wilderness of Zin, south of the Dead Sea, to the
entering in of Hamath. The latter statement implies
that they traversed what were afterwards called Judæa,
Samaria, and Galilee, and penetrated as far as the
valley of the Leontes, between the southern ranges of
Libanus and Antilibanus. The one account taken by
itself would make the journey of the spies northward
about a hundred miles; the other, three times as long.</p>

<p>A further difference is this: According to one of
the narratives Caleb alone encourages the people (xiii.
30; xiv. 24). But according to the other (xiii. 8, 16;
xiv. 6, 7), Joshua, as well as Caleb, is among the twelve,
and reports favourably as to the possibility of conquering
and possessing Canaan.</p>

<p>Without deciding on the critical points involved, we
may find a way of harmonising the apparent differences.
It is quite possible, for instance, that while some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
twelve were instructed to keep in the south of Canaan,
others were sent to the middle district and a third company
to the north. Caleb might be among those who
explored the south; while Joshua, having gone to the
far north, might return somewhat later and join his
testimony to that which Caleb had given. There is
no inconsistency between the portions ascribed to the
one narrative and those referred to the other; and the
account, as we have it, may give what was the gist of
several co-ordinate documents. As to any variance in
the reports of the spies, we can easily understand how
those who looked for smiling valleys and fruitful fields
would find them, while others saw only the difficulties
and dangers that would have to be faced.</p>

<p>The questions occur, why and at whose instance the
survey was undertaken. From Deuteronomy we learn
that a demand for it arose among the people. Moses
says (i. 22): "Ye came near unto me every one of
you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may
search the land for us, and bring us word again of the
way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which
we shall come." In Numbers the expedition is undertaken
at the order of Jehovah conveyed through Moses.
The opposition here is only on the surface. The people
might desire, but decision did not lie with them. It
was quite natural when the tribes had at length approached
the frontier of Canaan that they should seek
information as to the state of the country. And the
wish was one which could be sanctioned, which had
even been anticipated. The land of Canaan was already
known to the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and the praise of it as a land flowing with milk and
honey mingled with their traditions. In one sense
there was no need to send spies, either to report on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
fertility of the land or on the peoples dwelling in it.
Yet Divine Providence, on which men are to rely, does
not supersede their prudence and the duty that rests
with them of considering the way they go. The
destiny of a life or of a nation is to be wrought out in
faith; still we are to use all available means in order to
ensure success. So personality grows through providence,
and God raises men for Himself.</p>

<p>To the band of pioneers each tribe contributes a
man, and all the twelve are headmen, whose intelligence
and good faith may presumably be trusted. They
know the strength of Israel; they should also be able
to count upon the great source of courage and power&mdash;the
unseen Friend of the nation. Remembering what
Egypt is, they know also the ways of the desert; and
they have seen war. If they possess enthusiasm and
hope, they will not be dismayed by the sight of a few
walled towns or even of some Anakim. They will say,
"The Lord of hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is
our refuge." Yet there is danger that old doubts and
new fears may colour their report. God appoints men
to duty; but their personal character and tendencies
remain. And the very best men Israel can choose for
a task like this will need all their faithfulness and more
than all their faith to do it well.</p>

<p>The spies were to climb the heights visible in the
north, and look forth towards the Great Sea and away
to Moriah and Carmel. They were also to make their
way cautiously into the land itself and examine it.
Moses anticipates that all he has said in praise of
Canaan will be made good by the report, and the
people will be encouraged to enter at once on the final
struggle. When the desert was around them, unfruitful,
seemingly interminable, the Israelites might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
disposed to fear that journeying from Egypt they were
leaving the fertility of the world farther and farther
behind. Some may have thought that the Divine
promise had misled and deceived them, and that
Canaan was a dream. Even although they had now
overpassed that dreary region covered with coarse
gravel, black flints, and drifting sand, "the great and
terrible wilderness," what hope was there that northward
they should reach a land of olives, vineyards,
and flowing streams? The report of the spies would
answer this question.</p>

<p>Now in like manner the future state of existence
may seem dim and unreal, scarcely credible, to many.
Our life is like a series of marches hither and thither
through the desert. Neither as individuals nor as
communities do we seem to approach any state of
blessedness and rest. Rather, as years go by, does
the region become more inhospitable. Hopes once
cherished are one after another disappointed. The
stern mountains that overhung the track by which our
forefathers went still frown upon us. It seems impossible
to get beyond their shadow. And in a kind of
despair some may be ready to say: There is no promised
land. This waste, with its sere grass, its
burning sand, its rugged hills, makes the whole of life.
We shall die here in the wilderness like those who
have been before us; and when our graves are dug
and our bodies laid in them, our existence will have an
end. But it is a thoughtless habit to doubt that of
which we have no full experience. Here we have but
begun to learn the possibilities of life and find a clue to
its Divine mysteries. And even as to the Israelites in
the wilderness there were not wanting signs that pointed
to the fruitful and pleasant country beyond, so for us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
even now, there are previsions of the higher world.
Some shrubs and straggling vines grew in sheltered
hollows among the hills. Here and there a scanty crop
of maize was reared, and in the rainy season streams
flowed down the wastes. From what was known the
Israelites might reason hopefully to that which as yet
was beyond their sight. And are there not fore-signs
for the soul, springs opened to the seekers after God
in the desert, some verdure of righteousness, some
strength and peace in believing?</p>

<p>Science and business and the cares of life absorb
many and bewilder them. Immersed in the work of
their world, men are apt to forget that deeper draughts
of life may be drunk than they obtain in the laboratory
or the counting-house. But he who knows what love
and worship are, who finds in all things the food of
religious thought and devotion, makes no such mistake.
To him a future in the spiritual world is far more
within the range of hopeful anticipation than Canaan
was to one who remembered Egypt and had bathed in
the waters of the Nile. Is the heavenly future real?
It is: as thought and faith and love are real, as the
fellowship of souls and the joy of communion with God
are realities. Those who are in doubt as to immortality
may find the cause of that doubt in their own
earthliness. Let them be less occupied with the
material, care more for the spiritual possessions, truth,
righteousness, religion, and they will begin to feel an
end of doubt. Heaven is no fable. Even now we
have our foretaste of its refreshing waters and the fruits
that are for the healing of the nations.</p>

<p>The spies were to climb the hills which commanded
a view of the promised land. And there are heights
which must be scaled if we are to have previsions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the heavenly life. Men undertake to forecast the future
of the human race who have never sought those heights.
They may have gone out from camp a few miles or
even some days' journey, but they have kept in the
plain. One is devoted to science, and he sees as the
land of promise a region in which science shall achieve
triumphs hitherto only dreamt of, when the ultimate
atoms shall disclose their secrets and the subtle principle
of life shall be no longer a mystery. The social
reformer sees his own schemes in operation, some new
adjustment of human relations, some new economy or
system of government, the establishment of an order
that shall make the affairs of the world run smoothly,
and banish want and care and possibly disease from
the earth. But these and similar previsions are not
from the heights. We have to climb quite above the
earthly and temporal, above economics and scientific
theories. Where the way of faith rises, where the love
of men becomes perfect in the love of God, not in
theory but in the practical endeavour of earnest life,
there we ascend, we advance. We shall see the coming
kingdom of God only if we are heartily with God in the
ardour of the redeemed soul, if we follow in the footsteps
of Christ to the summits of Sacrifice.</p>

<p>The spies went forth from among tribes which had
so far made a good journey under the Divine guidance.
So well had the expedition sped that a few days' march
would have brought the travellers into Canaan. But
Israel was not a hopeful people nor a united people.
The thoughts of many turned back; all were not faithful
to God nor loyal to Moses. And as the people were,
so were the spies. Some may have professed to be
enthusiastic who had their doubts regarding Canaan
and the possibility of conquering it. Others may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
even wished to find difficulties that would furnish an
excuse for returning even to Egypt. Most were ready
to be disenchanted at least and to find cause for alarm.
In the south of Canaan a pastoral district, rocky and
uninviting towards the shore of the Dead Sea, was
found to be sparsely occupied by wandering companies
of Amalekites, Bedawin of the time, probably with a
look of poverty and hardship that gave little promise
for any who should attempt to settle where they roamed.
Towards Hebron the aspect of the country improved;
but the ancient city, or at all events its stronghold, was
in the hands of a class of bandits whose names inspired
terror throughout the district&mdash;Ahiman, Sheshai, and
Talmai, sons of Anak. The great stature of these men,
exaggerated by common report, together with stories
of their ferocity, seem to have impressed the timid
Hebrews beyond measure. And round Hebron the
Amorites, a hardy highland race, were found in occupation.
The report agreed on was that the people were
men of great stature; that the land was one which ate
up its inhabitants&mdash;that is to say, yielded but a precarious
existence. Just beyond Hebron vineyards
and olive-groves were found; and from the valley of
Eshcol one fine cluster of grapes was brought, hung
upon a rod to preserve the fruit from injury, an evidence
of capabilities that might be developed. Still the report
was an evil one on the whole.</p>

<p>Those who went farther north had to tell of strong
peoples&mdash;the Jebusites and Amorites of the central
region, the Hittites of the north, the Canaanites of the
seaboard, where afterwards Sisera had his headquarters.
The cities, too, were great and walled. These spies
had nothing to say of the fruitful plains of Esdraelon
and Jezreel, nothing to tell of the flowery meadows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the "murmuring of innumerable bees," the terraced
vineyards, the herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and
goats. They had seen the strong, resolute holders of
the soil, the fortresses, the difficulties; and of these
they brought back an account which caused abundant
alarm. Joshua and Caleb alone had the confidence of
faith, and were assured that Jehovah, if He delighted in
His people, would give them Canaan as an inheritance.</p>

<p>The report of the majority of the spies was one of
exaggeration and a certain untruthfulness. They must
have spoken altogether without knowledge, or else
allowed themselves to magnify what they saw, when they
said of the children of Anak, "We were in our own
sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."
Possibly the Hebrews were at this time somewhat ill-developed
as a race, bearing the mark of their slavery.
But we can hardly suppose that the Amorites, much
less the Hittites, were of overpassing stature. Nor
could many cities have been so large and strongly
fortified as was represented, though Lachish, Hebron,
Shalim, and a few others were formidable. On the
other hand, the picture had none of the attractiveness
it should have borne. These exaggerations and defects,
however, are the common faults of misbelieving and
therefore ignorant representation. Are any disposed
to leave the wilderness of the world and possess the
better country? A hundred voices of the baser kind
will be heard giving warning and presage. Nothing
is said about its spiritual fruit, its joy, hope, and peace.
But its hardships are detailed, the renunciations, the
obligations, the conflicts necessary before it can be
possessed. Who would enter on the hopeless task
of trying to cast out the strong man armed, who sits
entrenched&mdash;of holding at bay the thousand forces that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
oppose the Christian life? Each position must be taken
after a sore struggle and kept by constant watchfulness.
Little know they who think of becoming religious how
hard it is to be Christians. It is a life of gloom, of
constant penitence for failures that cannot be helped,
a life of continual trembling and terror. So the reports
go that profess to be those of experience and knowledge,
of men and women who understand life.</p>

<p>Observe also that the account given by those who
reconnoitred the land of promise sprang from an error
which has its parallel now. The spies went supposing
that the Israelites were to conquer Canaan and dwell
there purely for their own sake, for their own happiness
and comfort. Had not the wilderness journey been
undertaken for that end? It did not enter into the
consideration either of the people as a whole or of their
representatives that they were bound for Canaan in
order to fulfil the Divine purpose of making Israel a
means of blessing to the world. Here, indeed, a
spirituality of view was needful which the spies could
not be expected to have. Breadth of foresight, too,
would have been required which in the circumstances
scarcely lay within human power. If any of them had
taken account of Israel's spiritual destiny as a witness
for Jehovah in the midst of the heathen, could they
have told whether this land of Syria or some other
would be a fit theatre for the fulfilment of that high
destiny?</p>

<p>And in ignorance like theirs lies the source of
mistakes often made in judging the circumstances of
life, in deciding what will be wisest and best to undertake.
We, too, look at things from the point of view
of our own happiness and comfort, and, in a higher
range, of our religious enjoyment. If we see that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
are to be had in a certain sphere, by a certain movement
or change, we decide on that change, we choose
that sphere. But if neither temporal well-being nor
enjoyment of religious privilege appears to be certain,
our common practice is to turn in another direction.
Yet the truth is that we are not here, and we shall
never be anywhere, either in this world or another,
simply to enjoy, to have the milk and honey of a
smiling land, to fulfil our own desires and live to
ourselves. The question regarding the fit place or
state for us depends for its answer on what God means
to do through us for our fellow-men, for the truth, for
His kingdom and glory. The future which we with
greater or less success attempt to conquer and secure
will, as the Divine hand leads us on, prove different
from our dream in proportion as our lives are capable
of high endeavour and spiritual service. We shall
have our hope, but not as we painted it.</p>

<p>Who are the Calebs and Joshuas of our time? Not
those who, forecasting the movements of society, see
what they think shall be for their people a region of
comfort and earthly prosperity, to be maintained by
shutting out as far as possible the agitation of other
lands; but those who realise that a nation, especially
a Christian nation, has a duty under God to the whole
human race. Those are our true guides and come
with inspiration who bid us not be afraid in undertaking
the world-wide task of commending truth,
establishing righteousness, seeking the enfranchisement
and Christianisation of all lands.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the efforts of Caleb and afterwards
of Joshua to controvert the disheartening reports spread
by their companions, the people were filled with
dismay; and night fell upon a weeping camp. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
pictures of those Anakim and of the tall Amorites,
rendered more terrible by imagination, appear to have
had most to do with the panic. But it was the general
impression also that Canaan offered no attractions as
a home. There was murmuring against Moses and
Aaron. Disaffection spread rapidly, and issued in the
proposal to take another leader and return to Egypt.
Why had Jehovah brought them across the desert to
put them under the sword at last? The tumult
increased, and the danger of a revolt became so great
that Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the
assembly.</p>

<p>Always and everywhere <i>faithless</i> means foolish,
<i>faithless</i> means cowardly. By this is explained the
dejection and panic into which the Israelites fell, into
which men often fall. Our life and history are not
confided to the Divine care; our hope is not in God.
Nothing can save a man or a nation from vacillation,
despondency, and defeat but the conviction that Providence
opens the way and never fails those who press
on. No doubt there are considerations which might
have made Israel doubtful whether the conquest of
Canaan lay in the way of duty. Some modern
moralists would call it a great crime&mdash;would say that
the tribes could look for no success in endeavouring
to dispossess the inhabitants of Canaan, or even to find
a place among them. But this thought did not enter
into the question. Panic fell on the host, because
doubt of Jehovah and His purpose overcame the partial
faith which had as yet been maintained with no small
difficulty.</p>

<p>Now it was by the mouth of Moses Israel had been
assured of the promise of God. Broadly speaking,
faith in Jehovah was faith in Moses, who was their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
moralist, their prophet, their guide. Men here and
there, the seventy who prophesied for instance, had
their personal consciousness of the Divine power; but
the great mass of the people had the covenant, and
trusted it through the mediation of Moses. Had Moses
then, as the Israelites could judge, a right to command,
unquestionable authority as a revealer of the will of
the unseen God? Take away from the history every
incident, every feature, that may appear doubtful, and
there remains a personality, a man of distinguished
unselfishness, of admirable patience, of great sagacity,
who certainly was a patriot, and as certainly had
greater conceptions, higher enthusiasms, than any other
man of Israel. It was perhaps difficult for those who
were gross in nature and very ignorant to realise that
Moses was indeed in communication with an unseen,
omnipotent Friend of the people. Some might even
have been disposed to say: What if he is? What can
God do for us? If we are to get anything, we must
seek and obtain it for ourselves. Yet the Israelites as
a whole held the almost universal belief of those times,
the conviction that a Power above the visible world
does rule the affairs of earth. And there was evidence
enough that Moses was guided and sustained by the
Divine hand. The sagacious mind, the brave, noble
personality of Moses, made for Israel, at least for every
one in Israel capable of appreciating character and
wisdom, a bridge between the seen and the unseen,
between man and God.</p>

<p>We must not indeed deny that this conviction was
liable to challenge and revision. It must always be so
when a man speaks for God, represents God. Doubt
of the wisdom of any command meant doubt whether
God had really given it by Moses. And when it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
that the tribes had been unwisely brought to Canaan,
the reflection might be that Moses had failed as an
interpreter. Yet this was not the common conclusion.
Rather, from all we learn, was it the conclusion that
Jehovah Himself had failed the people or deceived them.
And there lay the error of unbelief which is constantly
being committed still.</p>

<p>For us, whatever may be said as to the composition
of the Bible, it is supremely, and as no other sacred
book can be, the Word of God. As Moses was the
one man in Israel who had a right to speak in Jehovah's
name, so the Bible is the one book which can claim to
instruct us in faith, duty, and hope. Speaking to us
in human language, it may of course be challenged.
At one point and another, some even of those who
believe in Divine communication to men may question
whether the Bible writers have always caught aright
the sound of the heavenly Word. And some go so far
as to say: There is no Divine Voice; men have given
as the Word of God, in good faith, what arose in their
own mind, their own exalted imagination. Nevertheless,
our faith, if faith we are to have at all, must rest
on this Book. We cannot get away from human
words. We must rely on spoken or written language
if we are to know anything higher than our own
thought. And what is written in the Bible has the
highest marks of inspiration&mdash;wisdom, purity, truth,
power to convince and convert and to build up a life
in holiness and in hope.</p>

<p>It remains true accordingly that doubt of the Bible
means for us, must mean, not simply doubt of the men
who have been instrumental in giving us the Book,
but doubt of God Himself. If the Bible did not speak
in harmony with nature and reason and the widest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
human experience when it lays down moral law, prescribes
the true rules and unfolds the great principles
of life, the affirmation just made would be absurd. But
it is a book of breadth, full of wisdom which every
age is verifying. It stands an absolute, the manifest
embodiment of knowledge drawn from the highest
sources available to men&mdash;from sources not earthly nor
temporary, but sublime and eternal. Faith, therefore,
must have its foundation on the teaching of this Book
as to "what man is to believe concerning God and
what duty God requires of man." And on the other
hand infidelity is and must be the result of rejecting
the revelation of the Bible, denying that here God
speaks with supreme wisdom and authority to our
souls.</p>

<p>The Israelites doubting Jehovah who had spoken
through Moses, that is to say, doubting the highest,
most inspiring word it was possible for them to hear,
turning away from the Divine reason that spoke, the
heavenly purpose revealed to them, had nothing to rely
upon. Confused inadequate counsels, chaotic fears,
waited immediately upon their revolt. They sank at
once to despondency and the most fatuous and impossible
projects. The men who stood against their despair
were made offenders, almost sacrificed to their fear.
Joshua and Caleb, facing the tumult, called for confidence.
"Fear not ye the people of the land," they said,
"for they are bread for us: their defence is removed
from over them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them
not." But all the congregation bade stone them with
stones; and it was only the bright glow of the pillar
of fire shining out at the moment that prevented a
dreadful catastrophe.</p>

<p>So the faithless generations fall back still into panic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
fatuity, and crime. Trusting in their resources, men
say, "No change need trouble us; we have courage,
wisdom, power, sufficient for our needs." But have
they unity, have they any scheme of life for which it is
worth while to be courageous? The hope of bare continuance,
of ignoble safety and comfort will not animate,
will not inspire. Only some great vision of Duty seen
along the track of the eternally right will kindle the
heart of a people; the faith that goes with that vision
will alone sustain courage. Without it, armies and
battle-ships are but a temporary and flimsy defence,
the pretext of a self-confidence, while the heart is
clouded with despair. Whether men say, We will
return to Egypt, refusing the call of Providence which
bids us fulfil a high destiny, or, still refusing to fulfil
it, We will maintain ourselves in the wilderness&mdash;they
have in secret the conviction that they are failures,
that their national organisation is a hollow pretence.
And the end, though it may linger for a time, will be
dismemberment and disaster.</p>

<p>Modern nations, nominally Christian, are finding it
difficult to suppress disorder, and occasionally we are
almost thrown into a state of panic by the activity of
revolutionists. Does the cause not lie in this, that the
<i>en avant</i> of Providence and Christianity is not obeyed
either in the politics or social economy of the people?
Like Israel, a nation has been led so far through the
wilderness, but advance can only be into a new order
which faith perceives, to which the voice of God calls.
If it is becoming a general conclusion that there is
no such country, or that the conquest of it is impossible,
if many are saying, Let us settle in the
wilderness, and others, Let us return to Egypt, what
can the issue be but confusion? This is to encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the anarchist, the dynamiter. The enterprise of
humanity, according to such counsels, is so far a failure,
and for the future there is no inspiring hope. And to
make economic self-seeking the governing idea of a
nation's movement is simply to abandon the true leader
and to choose another of some ignominious order.
Would it have been possible to persuade Moses to
hold the command of the tribes, and yet remain in the
desert or return to Egypt? Neither is it possible to
retain Christ as our captain and also to make this
world our home, or return to a practical heathenism,
relieved by abundance of food, the Hellenic worship
of beauty, the organisation of pleasure. For the great
enterprise of spiritual redemption alone will Christ be
our leader. We lose Him if we turn to the hopes of
this world and cease to press the journey towards the
city of God.</p>

<h2>XII

<i>THE DOOM OF THE UNBELIEVING</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xiv</h4>

<p>The spirit of revolt which came to a head in the
proposal to put Joshua and Caleb to death was
quelled by the fiery splendour that flashed out at
the tent of meeting; but disaffection continued, and
Moses realised with horror that immediate destruction
threatened the tribes. Jehovah would smite them with
pestilence, disinherit them, and raise up a new nation
greater and mightier than they. Moses himself should
be the father of the destined race.</p>

<p>The thought was one at which an ambitious man
would have grasped; and to entertain it might well
seem a good man's duty. In what better way could
one of earnest and courageous spirit serve the world
and the Divine purpose of grace? Moses stood as a
representative of Abraham, to whom the promise had
been first given, and of Jacob, to whom it had been
renewed. If the will of Heaven was that a fresh
beginning in the old succession should be made, the
honour was not lightly to be put aside. Moses now
saw, as Abraham saw, a great possibility. The Divine
purpose did not fail, though Israel proved unfit to
serve it; in the field of a more instructed age that
magnificent hope which made Abraham great would
blossom more generously and yield its fruit of blessing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
With the sense of this possible honour to himself, there
came, however, to Moses other and arresting thoughts.
For Abraham had become great by sacrifice, and only
one spiritually greater even than he could found a
worthier race. Did Moses not think of that scene on
Moriah, when the son of the promise lay stretched on
the altar, and feel himself inspired for a sacrifice of
his own? Yet what could it be? Nothing but the
silent inward refusal of that great honour which was
being put in his power, the honour of becoming even
higher than Abraham in the line of originators. True,
it seemed that necessity was laid on him. Yet might
not Jehovah intervene on Israel's behalf as once before
on Isaac's, when the moment of his death had almost
come? Not to sacrifice Israel was the call Moses
heard when he listened in the silence, but to sacrifice
his own hope, though it seemed to be pressed on him
by Providence. And this began to prove itself the
necessity. On the one hand he could not hide the
fear that even if the Israelites were settled in Canaan
a long period of education would be required to fit
them for national life and power; after many generations
they would be still incapable of any high spiritual task.
But if Israel perished, what would happen? The faith
of Jehovah, already established as an influence in the
world, would fall into abeyance. When doom fell on
Israel, the Egyptians would hear of it, Canaan would
hear of it. The desert, the valley of the Nile, the hills
of the Promised Land, would ring with the exultant cry
that Jehovah had failed. And then&mdash;how long would
the world have to wait till this seeming defeat could
be retrieved? Century after century had passed since
Abraham left his own land to fulfil the vocation of God.
Century after century would have to pass before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
sons of Moses could attain to any greatness, any power
to move the world. The instrument Jehovah had meanwhile
to use was imperfect; the tribes were not like a
strong two-edged sword in the hand of the King. Yet
they existed; they could be used, and Divine might,
Divine grace, could overcome their imperfection. Ere
the world grew older in ignorance and idolatry, Moses
would have the heavenly purpose wrought. For this
he will renounce, for this he must renounce, the honour
possible to himself. Let Jehovah do all.</p>

<p>His choice made, Moses intercedes with God. The
prayer has an air of simple anthropomorphism. He
appears to plead that Jehovah should not imperil His
own fame. The underlying thought is partly concealed
by the form of expression; but the meaning is clear.
It is the dawning power of the religion of God for
which Moses is concerned. He would not have that
lost to men which by the events of the exodus and the
wilderness journey has been so far secured. Egypt
is half persuaded; Canaan is beginning to see that
Jehovah is greater than Anubis and Thoth, than
Moloch and Baal. Was that impression to fade and
to be succeeded by doubt, possibly contempt of Jehovah
as Israel's God. He had brought His people into the
wilderness, but He could not establish them in Canaan;
therefore He slew them: if that were said, would not
the loss to mankind be incalculable? "Thou, Jehovah,
art seen face to face, and Thy cloud standeth over
them, and Thou goest before them in a pillar of cloud
by day, and in a pillar of fire by night." The astonished
lands have seen this; let them not return with greater
trust than ever to their own poor idols.</p>

<p>In the report of Moses' intercession words are quoted
which were part of the revelation of the Divine character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
at Sinai: "Jehovah slow to anger, and plenteous in
mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and that
will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity
of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and
fourth generation." The prayer quoting these latter
clauses is abundantly sincere; and it proceeds on the
belief that mercy rather than judgment is the delight
of God. The greatness of the Divine compassion
already shown time after time since the people left
Egypt is still relied upon. And the desire of Moses is
granted so far as it is in harmony with the character
and purpose of God. "Thou wast a God that forgavest
them, though Thou tookest vengeance of their doings"
(Psalm xcix. 8).</p>

<p>Jehovah says, "I have pardoned according to My
word." The national sin is not to be visited with
destruction of the nation. No pestilence shall exterminate
the murmurers, nor shall they be left without
the guidance of Moses and of the cloud to melt away
in the plagues of the wilderness. But yet the power
of Jehovah shall be shown in their punishment; the
manner of it shall be such that the earth shall be filled
with the glory of the Lord. The men who came out
of Egypt and have tempted Jehovah ten times shall
never see Canaan. Their carcases shall fall in the
desert. For forty years shall the Israelites wander
as shepherds till the evil generation shall have
disappeared.</p>

<p>Divine Providence judges the pusillanimity of men.
Their fear deprives them of that which is offered and
actually put within their grasp. They prove themselves
incapable when the time of decisive endeavour
comes, and a new generation must arise before the
ripeness of circumstance again opens the way. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
case of the Israelites shows that rebuke and disappointment
are necessary in the Divine discipline of human
life. Defects of character, of faith, are not overborne
by a <i>tour de force</i> in order that the development of a
heavenly purpose may be hastened. It would indeed
cease to be a heavenly purpose, if with easy forgiveness
God gave miraculous success. The result would be no
gain in the long-run to any good cause. If men fail,
God can wait for others who shall not fail. We are
apt to forget this; we think that we show proper trust
in the fulness of Divine pardon when we insist that men
who have erred and been forgiven, who have faithlessly
missed their opportunity and passed through penitence
into new zeal, shall be hurried on to the duties they
refused to face. But now, as in the times of Israel, the
law of adequate discipline forbids, the law of punishment
forbids. Humanity is not to be cheated of its
Divine instruction, nor shall any pretext of generosity
or necessity be urged in order that certain men may
enter a Canaan they once refused to possess. We
see a term set to a probation.</p>

<p>Does it appear an inordinate punishment, this denial
of Canaan to the unbelieving? There is no need to
think so. For the men and women who held back in
doubt of God, the wilderness, quite as well as Canaan,
would serve the main end, to teach them trust. Life
went on still under the protection of the Almighty.
The desert was His, as well as the land flowing with
milk and honey. Yea, in the desert they had, being
such as they were, fewer temptations to question the
power of God and their own need of Him than they
would have found in the land of promise. May we not
say that men who had been so ready to receive an evil
report of the land would have been confirmed in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
doubt of Jehovah if they had been allowed to cross the
frontier? Better for them to remain in the desert that
made no pretence to be anything else, than to enter
Canaan and find excuses for calling it a desert. No
individual was prevented from learning to know God
and trust Him; of that we may be sure. The way of
instruction was that of penitence and sorrow and continued
hardships. But there would have been no other
way for those unbelievers even if they had entered on
the promised inheritance. In Canaan, as well as in the
desert, they would have had to learn contrition, to
advance in moral life by means of temporal hardships
and defeat.</p>

<p>And there was a limitation of the judgment. Only
those from twenty years old and upward were included.
The young men and young women, presumably because
they had not bewailed their lot and cried against Moses
and God, having too much of the hopeful spirit of youth,
were not condemned to die in the wilderness. A
difference was there, and by the terms of the deliverance
was made clear, which often comes to light in
human history. The old, who should know most of the
goodness of God and His unfailing power, draw back;
the young and inexperienced are ready to advance.
Men who are occupied with affairs tend to think that
their wise management brings success, and they place
Divine Providence secondary to their own wisdom.
Shall we be able for this? they ask. Does this approve
itself to us as men of the world, responsible men?
If not, they think it would be folly to go forward even
at the call of God. But the young are not so wise in
their own experience; they are in the mood to dare:
the young and the trustful&mdash;men like Joshua and Caleb,
who have learned that power and success are of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and that His way is always safe. To calculate and act
on the basis of expediency is not the failing of the
young. Let us pray for men who have faith in the
future of humanity and of the Church to stand forth
and rally about them the youths, not spoiled by overwise
theories of life, who have still in their souls the
heavenly instinct of hope.</p>

<p>Caleb has here and elsewhere in the history peculiar
honour, all the more remarkable that he was, properly
speaking, no Israelite. The narrative at this point
associates his family with the tribe of Judah. But Caleb
was a Kenizzite (Numb. xxxii. 12); and Kenaz appears
in Gen. xxxvi. 11, 15, as an Edomite or descendant
of Esau. At what time this particular Kenizzite family
joined the expedition of Israel we have no hint. As
yet, however, there was no inter-marriage; and it should
be noticed that the district which in consideration of his
fidelity Caleb has for his inheritance in Canaan is the
same as was occupied by Kenizzites before the conquest.
There is, of course, no improbability in this; it may
rather appear to give proof of the genuineness of the
narrative. Caleb joins the Israelites, attaches himself to
Judah in the camp and on the march, proves himself a
faithful servant of God and of the host, and has the
promise of his forefathers' inheritance when the distribution
of Canaan shall be made. He reported
favourably of the region about Hebron; and Hebron
became his city, as we learn from Josh. xiv.</p>

<p>In contrast to the special promise made to Joshua
and Caleb is the fate of the other ten whose report
brought "a slander upon the land." These "died by
the plague before Jehovah." It would seem that before
Moses appealed to God on behalf of the people, the
pestilence was spreading which might have swept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Israelites down like Sennacherib's army in after-times.
And the ten false spies had been among the first to die.
Little indeed know men how soon Providence will convict
them of their faithlessness and rebellion. Let us
save our lives, they say, by holding back from duties
that involve difficulty and danger. Why advance
where we are sure to fall by the sword? But the
sword finds them nevertheless, or the plague lays hold
of them; and where then is the life they were so careful
to preserve? The men of Israel who said, "Let us
not go to Canaan, but return to Egypt," neither see
Canaan nor Egypt. They gain nothing they desire;
they lose all they were so careful to keep.</p>

<p>Suddenly at ver. 40 we are brought to a new
development. The people no sooner hear their doom
than they resolve to take the future into their own
hands. They acknowledge that they have sinned,
meaning, however, only that they have fallen into a
mistake the consequence of which they had not foreseen;
and with this inadequate confession of fault they
decide to make the advance into Canaan forthwith.
They do not see that instead of recovering their hope
in God by any such attempt they will really deepen the
alienation between themselves and Him. Submission
is indeed hard, but it is their one grace, their one duty.
If they press on into Canaan, they must go without
the Lord, as Moses warns them, and they shall not
prosper.</p>

<p>It is not enough when men have discovered an evil
heart of unbelief, and turned again in repentance, that
they take up the thread of life which has become
ravelled. Perverse faithlessness cannot be cured by
a sudden decision to resume the duty which was
abandoned in fear. The refusal was no superficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
thing, but had its source in the springs of will, the
character and habits of life. We are apt to judge
otherwise, and to suppose that we can alter the whole
current of our nature by a single act of choice. To-day
the trend is strongly in one direction, along a channel
which has been forming for many years; to-morrow
we think it possible to become other men, strong where
we were weak, determined upon that which we abhorred.
But something must intervene; some change must take
place deeper than our impulse. We must have the new
heart and the right spirit; and in proportion to the
gravity of the situation and the importance of the duty
to be done must the time of discipline be long. The
wilderness wandering had to be for many years because
the temper of a whole people was to be altered. For
a single person a far shorter ordeal may suffice. He
may pass through the stages of conviction, repentance,
and new creation in a few weeks or even days. Nay,
sometimes the regenerating Spirit brings about the
change apparently in a moment. Yet the rule is that
stability in faith must come slowly, that the way of
trial cannot be hastened. A great task, therefore, the
right doing of which is necessary to the open vindication
of religion, may not be gone about in a sudden
change of mind. We are not to take lightly, into
untried hands, the massive plough of the kingdom of
God.</p>

<p>In Canaan, the Amalekites and Canaanites, Moses
said, would dispute the advance of Israel,&mdash;Amalekites
skilled in desultory war, Canaanites long trained in
military art. These would fight without any sense
of the support of the true God. But how would the
Hebrews speed, meeting them on the same footing?
The contest would be then between human skill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
daring on either side; and there could be no doubt
as to the issue. Bands of men acquainted with the
country, disciplined in war as the tribes of Israel were
not, fighting for their fields and homes with a defence
of walled cities to fall back upon, would certainly win.
If the Hebrews went up, it would be without the sign
of Jehovah's presence; the ark of the covenant could
not be borne with the army on such an expedition.
Their attempt, being presumptuous, must end in
disaster.</p>

<p>Too often the conflicts in which the Church is
involved are of this very kind. There is profession of
high moral design and Christian principle. Ostensibly
it is for the sake of true religion that something is
undertaken. But in reality the affair is not one that
belongs to the essence of faith. It is perhaps a
question of prestige, of exclusive claim to certain rights
or moneys, the very last thing a Christian church should
insist upon. Then the contest is between human
diplomacy and resolution, whether on the one side
or the other. It is idle to call a campaign like this
a holy war. The ark of the covenant does not accompany
the army that calls itself Jehovah's. As Israel
found that even Amalekites and Canaanites were too
strong for her, so has the Church often found that
men whom she termed unbelievers were superior to her
in the arms she chose to use. Again and again have
her forces had to retire smitten even unto Hormah.
For those who are called unbelievers and atheists have
their rights; and they will always be able to maintain
their rights against a presumptuous church which
"goes up into the mountain" without the sanction
of its living Head.</p>

<p>It was no general advance of the tribes that on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
occasion ended in defeat. The solid, resolute march
of the whole people was a very different thing from the
half-hearted sally of some hundreds of fighting men.
When the host of the Israelites, men, women, and
children, moved together, the men of war had support
in the sympathy of those they defended, in the prayers
of the priest and of the people. They were nerved to
play the part of heroes by the thought that all depended
upon them, that if they failed their wives and children
would be put to the sword. And again there is a
parallel in the advance of the Church against her
adversaries. If the officials only go out to fight, if it
is their affair, their expedition, if there is no strong
onward movement of the whole host, what is there to
give support to the enterprise? The fighting men
may seem to have heart enough for their battle; but
the underlying feeling that they are not engaged in the
defence of the Gospel itself, or in guarding any position
on which the power and success of the Gospel depend,
must always, and properly, weaken their arms. There
is all the difference in the world between an ecclesiastical
battle and the contest for vital faith. And it is a
matter of regret that so much of the strength and
ardour of good men should be wasted in downright
earthly fighting, when the feeling of the Church as a
whole is not with those who claim to be her army.
Let all the tribes, that is to say all the churches of
Christ that are of one mind as to vital truth, advance
together, without jealousy, without mutual contempt,
and the opposition to Christianity will practically melt
away.</p>

<p>From the twenty-first chapter, which appears to open
with a reminiscence of the first attack on Canaan, we
gather that one of those who opposed the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
was the Canaanite King of Arad. The advance appears
therefore to have been made by way of Hezron and
Beersheba. The mountains visible from the camp were
likely the chalk hills beyond the "Ascent of Akrabbim."
These passed, probably near Hezron, a valley opened,
stretching away towards Hebron. The Amalekites
gathering from every wady, and the Canaanites from
the ridge to the right, where Arad lay, seem to have
fallen upon the Hebrews with a sudden onset. While
many escaped others were slain or taken captive. A
keen memory of the defeat survived; but it was not
till long afterwards, in the days of the judges, that the
strongholds of the region were reduced.</p>

<h2>XIII<br /><br />

<i>OFFERINGS: SABBATH-KEEPING: DRESS</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xv</h4>

<p>The enactments of this chapter regarding meal
offerings and drink offerings, the heave offerings
of the first dough, and the atonement for unwitting
errors belong to the cultus of Canaan. Nothing
generic distinguishes the first and third of these statutes
from some that were presumably to be observed in the
desert; but the note is explicit, "When ye be come
into the land of your habitations which I give unto
you," "When ye be come into the land whither I bring
you." The whole chapter, with its instance of presumptuous
sin introduced by the clause, "And while
the children of Israel were in the wilderness," marking
a return to that time, and its commandment regarding
the fringes or tassels of blue to be attached to the dress
as remembrancers of obligations, may appear at first
sight without any reference either to what has preceded
or what follows. The compilers, however, have a
definite purpose in view. The presumption of Korah
and his company, and of Dathan and Abiram, is in
contrast to the unwitting faults for which atonement
is provided, and it comes under the category of what is
"done with a high hand"&mdash;a form of blasphemy which
is to be punished with death. The case of the Sabbath-breaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
is an instance of this unpardonable sin, and
sends its light on to the incidents that follow. Even
the memorial fringes or tassels, and the prophetic
sentences that accompany the command to wear them,
seem to be forewarnings of the doom of sacrilegious
men.</p>


<p>1. <span class="smcap">Meal and Drink Offerings.</span>&mdash;The statute regarding
offerings "to make a sweet savour unto Jehovah"
is specially occupied with prescribing the proportion of
flour and oil and wine to be presented along with the
animal brought for a burnt offering or sacrifice. Any
one separating himself in terms of a vow, or desiring
to express gratitude for some Divine favour, or again
on the occasion of a sacred festival when he had special
cause of rejoicing before God, might bring a lamb, a
ram, or an ox as his oblation; and the meal and drink
offerings were to vary with the value of the animal
brought for sacrifice. The law does not demand the
same offering of every person under similar circumstances.
According to his means or his gratitude he
may give. But deciding first as to his burnt or slain
offering, he must add to it, for a lamb, the tenth of an
ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil,
and also a quarter of a hin of wine. For a bullock, the
quantities were to be three-tenths of an ephah of fine
flour, with half a hin of oil, and, as a drink offering,
half a hin of wine.</p>

<p>The provision is a singular one, based on some sense
of what was becoming which we cannot pretend to
revive. But it points to a rule which the Apostle Paul
may have recognised in this and other Jewish statutes
as belonging to universal morality: "Take thought
for things honourable in the sight of all men." To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
make a show of generosity by giving a bullock, while
the flour and oil and wine were withheld, was not
seemly. Neither is it seemly for a Christian to be
lavish in his gifts to the Church, but withhold the
meal offering and drink offering he owes to the poor.
Throughout the whole range of use and expenditure,
personal and of the family, a proportion is to be found
which it is one of the Christian arts to determine, one
of the Christian duties to observe. And nothing is
right unless all is right. The penny saved here takes
away the sweet savour of the pound given there. No
man is in this to be a law to himself. Public justice
and Divine are to be satisfied.</p>

<p>The presence or absence of oil in an oblation marked
its character. The sin offering and the jealousy offering
were without oil. The "oil of joy" (Isa. lxi. 3) accompanied
festal and peace offerings. All ordinances
prescribing the oblation of wine and oil necessarily
belonged to the cultus of Canaan, for in the wilderness
neither of these elements of the sacrifice could be
always had. The idea underlying the peace offerings,
with their accompanying meal and drink offerings, was
unquestionably that of feasting with Jehovah, enjoying
His bounty at His table. Acknowledgment was made
that the cattle on the hills were His, that it was He
who gave the harvest, the vintage, and the fruit of
the olive-grove. Confession of man's indebtedness to
Jehovah as Lord of nature was interwoven with the
whole sacrificial system.</p>

<p>In connection with this ordinance of meal and drink
offerings, and that of atonement for unintentional failures
in duty (ver. 22 ff.), it is very carefully enacted that
the law shall be the same for the "homeborn" and
the "stranger." "For the assembly there shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
one statute for you and for the stranger that sojourneth
with you, a statute for ever throughout your generations:
as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the
Lord." The design is to secure religious unity, and
by means of it gradually to incorporate with Israel all
dwellers in the land. While certain ordinances were
intended to make Israel a holy nation separated and
consecrated to Jehovah, this admission of strangers to
the privileges of the covenant has another design. In
the Book of Deuteronomy (vii. 2) a statute occurs
that entirely excludes from citizenship and incorporation
all Canaanites, Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites,
Hivites, Girgashites, and Perizzites. There was to be
no intermarriage with them, no toleration of them, lest
they led Israel away into idolatry. The statute is
enforced by the words, "For thou art an holy people
unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath
chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself,
above all peoples that are upon the face of the earth."
With this emphatic assertion of the severance of the
Hebrews from other races the strain of Numbers, as
well as Exodus and Leviticus, generally agrees. When
we endeavour to harmonise with it the admission of
strangers to the right and joy of sacrificial festivals,
we at once meet the difficulty that no other races
were fitter to be received into religious confraternity
than those of Canaan. Neither Babylonians, Syrians,
Ph&#339;nicians, nor Philistines were free from the taint
of idolatry; and however degrading the rites of the
Canaanites were, some of the other nations followed
practices quite as revolting.</p>

<p>We know that for a long period of Israel's history
strangers were, according to the statute presently
under consideration, admitted to the fellowship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
religion, as well as to high office in the state. "We
have only to study the Book of Joshua to discover
that the Israelites, like the Saxons in Britain, destroyed
the cities and not the population of the country, and
that the number of cities actually overthrown was not
very large. We have only to turn to the list of
the 'mighty men' of David to learn how many of
them were foreigners, Hittites, Ammonites, Zobahites,
and even Philistines of Gath (2 Sam. xv. 18, 19;
vi. 10). Nor must it be forgotten that David himself
was partly a Moabite by descent."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In accordance
with this large tolerance we might be disposed to
include among the "strangers" admitted to privilege
men belonging to races that inhabited Canaan before
the conquest. Even Deuteronomy seems in one
passage to exclude none but Ammonites and Moabites;
and the covenant law of Exod. xxiii. commands
generous treatment of the stranger. In contrast to
the "homeborn," strangers may appear to mean those
only who had come from other countries and chosen
to identify themselves with the faith and fortunes of
Israel; still this passage attempts no such definition,
and on the whole we must allow that the Mosaic law
in regulating the political and social position of resident
non-Israelites showed "a spirit of great liberality."
They had, of course, to conform to many laws&mdash;those,
for instance, of marriage, and those which forbade the
eating of blood and the flesh of animals not properly
slaughtered. If uncircumcised, they could not keep the
Passover; but being circumcised, they had equal rights
with the Hebrews. The purpose evidently was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
make an open way to the benefits of Israel's government
and religion.</p>

<p>The heave offering of the first dough is placed
(ver. 20) side by side with the heave offering of the
threshing-floor of the first sheaves. In Leviticus
(xxiii. 17) a harvest oblation is ordered&mdash;two wave-loaves
of fine flour baken with leaven. Here the heave
offering of a cake made from the first dough is not
accompanied with sacrifices of animals, but is of a
simple kind, mainly a tribute to the priests. The
Deuteronomic statute regarding firstfruits, which were
to be put in a basket and set down before the altar,
prescribed a formula of dedication beginning, "An
Aramean ready to perish was my father, and he went
down into Egypt": and the offering of these firstfruits
was to be an occasion of joy&mdash;"Thou shalt rejoice in
all the good which the Lord thy God hath given unto
thee and unto thine house, thou and the Levite, and
the stranger that is in the midst of thee." There can
be no question that the most developed statute regarding
these harvest offerings is that given in Leviticus,
where the exact time for the presentation of the loaves
is fixed, the fiftieth day after the Sabbath, from the day
when the sheaf was brought. The feast accompanying
the offering of the loaves came to be known as that of
Pentecost.</p>

<p>Passing now to the law of atonement for unintentional
omissions of duty, we notice that the introductory
sentences (vv. 22, 23) have a peculiar retrospective
cast. They seem to point back to the time when the
Lord gave commandment by the hand of Moses. It
would appear that in course of years discovery was
made that portions of the law were neglected, and the
provisions of this statute were to relieve the nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and individuals of accumulating defilement. "When
ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments,
which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses, even all that
the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses,
from the day that the Lord gave commandment, and
onward throughout your generations; then it shall be,
if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the
congregation"&mdash;so runs the preamble. A series of
statutes in Lev. iv. contemplates offences of a like
kind, when something has been done which the Lord
commanded not to be done. The enactment of Numbers
appears to point to a "complete falling away of the
congregation from the whole of the law," an unconscious
apostasy. Maimonides understands the provision as
relating to guilt incurred by the people in adopting
customs and usages of the heathen that seemed to be
reconcilable with the law of Jehovah, though they really
led to contempt and neglect of His commandments.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>For the nation as a whole, under these circumstances,
atonement was to be made by the burnt offering of a
young bullock with its meal offering and drink offering,
and the sin offering of a he-goat. In this purgation
all strangers resident with Israel are specially included.
When any person discovered that he had neglected a
precept, he was to offer a she-goat of the first year
for a sin offering. The Israelite and the stranger
alike had in this way access to the sanctuary. But in
contrast to unintentional omission of duty was set
deliberate neglect of it. For this there was no atonement.
Whether the high-handed transgressor was
homeborn or a stranger, he was to be utterly cut off
as a blasphemer; his iniquity rested upon him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
distinction is morally sound; and the punishment of
the rebel against authority&mdash;apparently nothing less
than death, or perhaps, if he has fled the land, outlawry&mdash;is
such as the theocratic idea obviously required.
It was Jehovah Himself who was defied. A man who,
as it were, shook his fist in rebellion against God had
no right to live in His world, under the protection of
His beneficent laws.</p>

<p>The distinction between unwitting neglect and open
rejection runs through the whole range of duty, natural,
Hebrew, Christian. What a man knows to be right
he has before him as a Divine law of moral conduct.
By the highest obligations, under which he lies to the
Lord of conscience, to his fellow-men, and to himself,
he is bound to obey. Judaism added the authority of
revelation&mdash;the Mosaic law, the prophetic word. Christianity
still further adds the authority of the word
spoken by the Son of God, and the obligation imposed
by His death as the manifestation of eternal love. In
proportion as the Divine will is made clear, and the law
enforced by revelation and grace, the sin of rejection
becomes greater and more blasphemous. But, on the
other hand, the unwitting transgressor, be he heathen
or imperfectly instructed Christian, has under the new
covenant, in which mercy and justice go hand in hand,
no less consideration than the Hebrew who unintentionally
erred. There is no law that cuts him off from
his people. Wide as this principle may reach, it must
be that according to which men are judged. Many,
knowing the invisible things of God "through the
things that are made," are without excuse. They
"hold down the truth in unrighteousness"; they are
high-handed transgressors. But others who have no
knowledge of the Divine law, and break it unwittingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
have their atonement: God provides it. Nor are we
to impeach Divine Providence by judging before the
time.</p>

<p>It may be asked, Why, since defiant rejection of
Christian law is more blasphemous than high-handed
breach of the old Hebrew law, the providence of God
does not punish it? If any one with Christ and His
cross in view is guilty of injustice, or of hatred which
is murder, does he not prove himself unworthy to live
in God's world? And why, then, does he not suffer
at once the doom of his rebellion? The theory of
some stern moralists has been that human government
should administer the justice of Heaven and cut off the
unbeliever. In many a notable case this has been
done, and has caused a righteous horror which continues
to be felt. But although men cannot safely undertake
the punishment of such offenders, why does not God?
Christ boldly stated that here and now this is not the
method of the Divine government, but that men enjoy
the Father's mercy even when they are unjust, unthankful,
and evil. Yet He spoke of judgment universal&mdash;judgment
and retribution that shall not miss a single
sinner, a single secret sin. And His view of the
theocracy clearly is that meanwhile God by mercy to
the defiant desires to train men in mercy, by forbearance
towards the unthankful and evil commends to us
like patience and endurance. Transgressors are to have
their full opportunity of repentance, to which the very
goodness of God calls them. But justice which delays is
not unobservant. Though He who reigns moves slowly
to His end, He will not fail to reach it. "He hath
appointed a day in the which He will judge the world
in righteousness." As for human law, its sphere is
fixed. Society must protect itself against crime, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
is to do so in the name of God, in conformity with
the eternal principles of righteousness. The Hebrew
temper may seem to have carried this principle into a
range that was perilous to enter, as in the instance
immediately to be considered; yet the protection of
society was even then the immediate motive, not vain
jealousy for the honour of God. For ourselves, we
have a duty which must be done without assumption
or hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The various subjects of thought suggested here
should be followed out. For us, they are complicated
on the social as well as the religious side by certain
theories that are in vogue. The duty of civil government,
for example, is on one side extended beyond
its proper range by the attempt to give it authority in
the domain of religious truth; on the other hand it is
unduly restricted by toleration of what is against the
well-being of society. The Christian moralist has
much to ponder in relation to popular opinions and the
trend of modern legislation.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Sabbath-Breaker.</span>&mdash;If the actual sequence
of events is followed in the narrative of Numbers, it
must have been after the condemnation of the adult
Israelites that judgment of the man who was found
infringing the Sabbath law had to be executed; and
some who were themselves under reprobation took
part in convicting and punishing this offender. There
is a difficulty here which on high moral grounds it
is impossible to explain away. Disaffection and revolt
had brought on the mass of the people the sentence of
destruction; and this had only been exchanged on
Moses' intercession for the forty years of wandering.
Should not sins that were visited with this penalty have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
excluded all who were guilty of them from any judicial
act? But the same objection would, if admitted,
prevent all of us from taking part in the execution of
law. Neither the judge nor the jury, neither those
who legislate nor those who administer law, are free
from moral fault. The whole system dealing with
crime has this defect; and Israel in the wilderness was
as much entitled as modern society to take in hand
the correction of offenders, the maintenance of public
well-being.</p>

<p>The law which had been broken was one specially
connected with duty to God. Sabbath-keeping might
indeed seem to belong to worship rather than to social
morality. The seventh day was the Sabbath of
Jehovah. It was to be kept holy to Him, made a
delight for His sake. The statute regarding it belonged
to the first table of the Decalogue. Still, the commandment
had a social as well as a religious side. In goodwill
to men Jehovah required the day to be kept holy
to Him. Had one and another like this offender been
allowed to set aside the fourth commandment, the
interests of the whole congregation would soon have
suffered. It was for the good of the race, physically
as well as intellectually and spiritually, the Sabbath
was to be kept. Those who guarded the sanctity of
the Sabbath were guarding not the honour of God
alone, though they may have thought that the chief
merit of their watchfulness, but the interests of the
people, a precious heritage of the nation.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to maintain that judgment was
given by Moses solely on the ground that the man who
gathered sticks on the Sabbath was an offender against
the public well-being. The thought of Jehovah's
"jealousy" was constantly kept before the mind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Israel, for by that idea, better than any other, beneficent
legislation was supported in a rude age; and
judgment no doubt rested mainly on this. Yet the
interference of the people and their share in the
execution of punishment are to be justified by the
undoubted fact that Israel could not afford to let
the Sabbath be lost. Even those who were to a
great extent earthly could perceive this. And if the
punishment seems disproportionate, we must remember
that it was the presumptuous temper of the man
rather than his actual fault that was judged criminal.
St. James said, no doubt from this point of view,
"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend
in one point, he is become guilty of all." The criminal
act was that of breaking down, with daring hand, the
safeguard of social and religious prosperity.</p>

<p>And there is a sense in which without Pharisaism
those who are concerned for the public well-being may
still insist on the strict enforcement of the laws that
guard the day of rest. Though all days are alike
sacred to spiritually minded persons, yet bodily health
and mental soundness are bound up more than men in
general know with the Sabbatic interval between labour
and labour. The Puritanism often scoffed at is far
more philanthropic than the humanitarianism, so-called,
which derides it. And when any one enforces the duty
of Sabbath-keeping by insisting on God's claim to the
seventh day, his belief is no superstition. Convict him
first of advocating what is against the good of men,
irrational, absurd, before venturing to call him superstitious.
If what is advanced as a claim of God can
be proved to be really for the good of men, it is a virtue
to insist that for God's sake as well as the sake of men
it should be rendered. There were persons in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Lord's time who made Sabbath-keeping a superstition.
Against them He testified. But it is in His name who
was the great Friend of men the Sabbath law is now
insisted on; and the day of rest has all the higher
sanction that it commemorates His resurrection from
the dead, His promise of that new life which relief
from labour enables us to pursue.</p>

<p>The institution of the Sabbath and the scrupulous
observance of it were, for Israel, and are still for all
believers in Divine religion, most important means of
maintaining unity in the faith. Now that many causes
interfere with the simultaneous exhibition of regard for
other symbols of Christian belief, the day of rest and
worship gives a universal opportunity which it would
be fatal to neglect. It has the advantage of beginning
to claim men on the ground where religion first appeals
to them, that of God's care for their temporal well-being.
Those with whom religious feeling is quite elementary
must see that a boon of incalculable value is offered in
this recurring refreshment to the wearied body and
strained mind. And with progress in religious culture
the benefit of the day of rest is found to advance. The
opportunities of worship, of religious meditation and
service, which it brings will be esteemed as the value
of Christian fellowship, the importance of Christian
knowledge, and the duty of Christian endeavour are
successively understood. On all these grounds the
Sabbath, or Lord's Day, is for modern religion, as for
that of the old covenant, a great declaration, a means
of unity and development which the spiritual will
earnestly uphold. Let it fail, and distinction between
religious and non-religious will be without a sign.
No doubt the reality is more by far than the symbol.
Yet fellowship, for which in many cases the Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
alone gives opportunity, is far more than a symbol;
and unity requires an outward manifestation. Nothing
could be more perilous to the religious life of our people
than the tendency, shown by many who profess Christianity
and sanctioned by some of its teachers, to make
the Sabbath a day of self-pleasing, of mere individualism,
and incoherent secularity.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Memorial Tassels.</span>&mdash;The unique sumptuary
law with which the chapter closes may be regarded as
a sequence of the Sabbath-breaker's conviction. That
Israelites might never be without a reminder of their
duty, and of the Divine laws they were scrupulously to
observe, these tassels with a band of blue were to be
constantly worn. It appears to us singular that men
should be expected to pay heed to such mementoes as
these. We are apt to say, If the laws of God were not
in their hearts, the <i>zizith</i> would scarcely make them
more attentive; and if they had the laws in their hearts,
they would need no memorials of obligation. But the
ornament was something more than a reminder of duty.
It was a badge of honour, and became more so as the
Israelites understood their high position among the
peoples. The <i>zizith</i> would be like an order, a mark of
rank; or like the uniform of his regiment which to the
good soldier recalls its history. The Hebrew would
have to live up to his duty as signified by these
attachments of his dress.</p>

<p>And Israelites were to be distinguished by the <i>zizith</i>
from those who were of other races, not under law to
Jehovah. Every man who wore this badge would be
able to count on the sympathy of every other Israelite.
The symbol became a means of rousing the <i>esprit</i> of the
nation, and binding it together in a zealous fraternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
The nature of the badge appears to us peculiar; but
the value of it cannot be denied. The modern peoples,
far as they have travelled from the old ways of the
Hebrews, retain the use of symbolic dress, the liking
for ornaments, by which a man's life may be known.</p>

<p>The name <i>zizith</i> is derived from a word meaning
blossom. The tassel was formed of twisted threads
bound by a cord or ribbon of blue to the garment.
It was the blossom of the robe, so to speak, hanging
by a blue stem. The ornament is again mentioned in
Deut. xxii. 12, where it has another name, <i>gedilim</i>,
enlargements. With extraordinary pride the Jews of
our own time still wear the <i>talith</i>, which is a fantastical
development of the <i>zizith</i> of Numbers. "The rabbins
observe that each string consisted of eight threads,
which, with the number of knots and the numerical
value of the letters in the word, make 613, which,
according to them, is the exact number of the precepts
in the law." The Pharisees in Christ's time enlarged
their phylacteries, displaying superfluously the proofs
of their Hebrew orthodoxy and zeal. It is the danger
of all symbols. In the youth of a people they have
meaning; they express fact, they give honour. The
Israelite wearing his felt himself reminded, put on his
honour, not to go about "according to his own heart
and his own eyes by which he used to go a-whoring."
But afterwards the zeal became that of pride, the symbol
a mere amulet or a token of self-sufficiency. The Jew
of to-day is partly kept separate by his talith, and
because he wears it, feels himself in touch with the
fathers and heroes and prophets of his people. But
he also feels, what is not always good, his remoteness
from heathen and Christian "dogs."</p>

<p>And Christian symbols, the few sanctioned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Scripture, the others that have crept into use in the
course of history, bring with their use a similar danger.
In many cases they are signs of privilege rather than
memorials of duty. They minister to pride, rather
than stimulate zeal in the service of God and men.
The crucifix itself, with consummate superstition, is
worn and kissed as a talisman.</p>

<h2>XIV<br /><br />

<i>KORAH, DATHAN, AND ABIRAM</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xvi., xvii</h4>


<p>Behind what appears in the history, there must
have been many movements of thought and
causes of discontent which gradually led to the events
we now consider. Of the revolts against Moses which
occurred in the wilderness, this was the most widely
organised and involved the most serious danger. But
we can only conjecture in what way it arose, how it was
related to previous incidents and tendencies of popular
feeling. It is difficult to understand the report, in
which Korah appears at one time closely associated
with Dathan and Abiram, at other times quite apart
from them as a leader of disaffection. According to
Wellhausen and others, three narratives are combined
in the text. But without going so far in the way
of analysis we clearly trace two lines of revolt: one
against Moses as leader; the other against the Aaronic
priesthood. The two risings may have been distinct;
we shall however deal with them as simultaneous and
more or less combined. A great deal is left unexplained,
and we must be guided by the belief that
the narrative of the whole book has a certain coherency,
and that facts previously recorded must have had their
bearing on those now to be examined.</p>

<p>The principal leader of revolt was Korah, son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Izhar, a Levite of the family of Kohath; and with him
were associated two hundred and fifty "princes of the
congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown,"
some of them presumably belonging to each of the
tribes as is shown incidentally in xxvii. 3. The complaint
of this company&mdash;evidently representing an
opinion widely held, was that Moses and Aaron took
too much upon them in reserving to themselves the
whole arrangement and control of the ritual. The two
hundred and fifty, who according to the law had no
right to use censers, were so far in opposition to the
Aaronic priesthood that they were provided with the
means of offering incense. They claimed for themselves
on behalf of the whole congregation, whom they
declared to be holy, the highest function of priests.
With Korah were specially identified a number of
Levites who, not content with being separated to do
the service of the tabernacle, demanded the higher
sacerdotal office. It might seem from vv. 10, 11, that
all the two hundred and fifty were Levites; but this is
precluded by the earlier statement that they were
princes of the congregation, called to the assembly.
So far as we can gather, the tribe of Levi did not
supply princes, "men of renown," in this sense.
While Moses deals with Korah and his company,
Dathan, Abiram, and On, who belong to the tribe of
Reuben, stand in the background with their grievance.
Invited to state it, they complain that Moses has not
only brought the congregation out of a land "flowing
with milk and honey," to kill them in the wilderness,
failing to give them the inheritance he promised; but
he has made himself a prince over the host, determining
everything without consulting the heads of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
tribes. They ask if he means "to put out the eyes
of these men,"&mdash;that is, to blind them to the real purpose
he has in view, whatever it is, or to make them
his slaves after the Babylonian fashion, by actually
boring out the eyes of each tenth man, perhaps. The
two hundred and fifty are called by Moses to bring
their censers and the incense and fire they have been
using, that Jehovah may signify whether He chooses
to be served by them as priests, or by Aaron. The
offering of incense over, the decree against the whole
host as concerned in this revolt is made known, and
Moses intercedes for the people. Then the Voice commands
that all the people shall separate themselves
from the "tabernacle" of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
apparently as if some tent of worship had been erected
in rivalry of the true tabernacle. Dathan and Abiram
are not at the "tabernacle," but at some little distance,
in tents of their own. The people remove from the
"tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram," and on
the terrible invocation of judgment pronounced by
Moses, the ground cleaves asunder and all the men
that appertain unto Korah go down alive into the pit.
Afterwards, it is said, "fire came forth from the Lord
and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that
offered the incense." "The men that appertained unto
Korah" may be the presumptuous Levites, most closely
identified with his revolt. But the two hundred and
fifty consumed by the fire are not said to have been
swallowed by the cleaving earth; their censers are
taken up "out of the burning," as devoted or sacred,
and beaten into plates for a covering of the altar.</p>

<p>On the morrow the whole congregation, even more
disaffected than before, is in a state of tumult. The cry
is raised that Moses and Aaron "have killed the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of Jehovah." Forthwith a plague, the sign of Divine
anger, breaks out. Atonement is made by Aaron, who
runs quickly with his burning censer "into the midst of
the assembly," and "stands between the dead and the
living." But fourteen thousand seven hundred die
before the plague is stayed. And the position of Aaron
as the acknowledged priest of Jehovah is still further
confirmed. Rods or twigs are taken, one for each tribe,
all the tribes having been implicated in the revolt; and
these rods are laid up in the tent of meeting. When
a day has passed, the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi
is found to have put forth buds and borne almonds.
The close of the whole series of events is an exclamation
of amazed anxiety by all the people: "Behold, we
perish, we are undone, we are all undone. Every one
that cometh near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah dieth:
shall we perish all of us?"</p>

<p>Now throughout the narrative, although other issues
are involved, there can be no question that the main
design is the confirmation of the Aaronic priesthood.
What happened conveyed a warning of most extraordinary
severity against any attempt to interfere with
the sacerdotal order as established. And this we can
understand. But it becomes a question why a revolt
of Reubenites against Moses was connected with that
of Korah against the sole priesthood of the Aaronic
house. We have also to consider how it came about
that princes out of all the tribes were to be found provided
with censers, which they were apparently in the
habit of using to burn incense to Jehovah. There is
a Levitical revolt; there is an assumption by men in
each tribe of priestly dignity; and there is a protest by
men representing the tribe of Reuben against the
dictatorship of Moses. In what way might these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
different movements arise and combine in a crisis that
almost wrecked the fortunes of Israel?</p>

<p>The explanation supplied by Wellhausen on the
basis of his main theory is exceedingly laboured, at
some points improbable, at others defective. According
to the Jehovistic tradition, he says,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the rebellion proceeds
from the Reubenites, and is directed against
Moses as leader and judge of the people. The historical
basis of this is dimly discerned to be the fall of
Reuben from its old place at the head of the brother
tribes. Out of this story, says Wellhausen, at some
time or other not specified, "when the people of the
congregation, <i>i.e.</i>, of the Church, have once come on
the scene," there arises a second version. The author
of the agitation is now Korah, a prince of the tribe of
Judah, and he rebels not only against Moses but against
Moses and Aaron as representing the priesthood.
"The jealousy of the secular grandees is now directed
against the class of hereditary priests instead of against
the extraordinary influence on the community of a
heaven-sent hero." Then there is a third addition
which "belongs likewise to the Priestly Code, but not
to its original contents." In this, Korah the prince of
the tribe of Judah is replaced by another Korah, head
of a "post-exilic Levitical family"; and "the contest
between clergy and aristocracy is transformed into a
domestic strife between the higher and inferior clergy
which was no doubt raging in the time of the narrator."
All this is supposed to be a natural and easy explanation
of what would otherwise be an "insoluble enigma."
We ask, however, at what period any family of Judah
would be likely to claim the priesthood, and at what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
post-exilic period there was "no doubt" a strife between
the higher and inferior clergy. Nor is there any
account here of the two hundred and fifty princes of
the congregation, with their partially developed ritual
antagonistic to that of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>We have seen that according to the narrative of
Numbers seventy elders of the tribes were appointed
to aid Moses in bearing the heavy burden of administration,
and were endowed with the gift of prophecy
that they might the more impressively wield authority
in the host. In the first instance, these men might be
zealous helpers of Moses, but they proved, like the
rest, angry critics of his leadership when the spies
returned with their evil report. They were included
with the other men of the tribes in the doom of the
forty years' wandering, and might easily become
movers of sedition. When the ark was stationed
permanently at Kadesh, and the tribes spread themselves
after the manner of shepherds over a wide range
of the surrounding district, we can easily see that the
authority of the seventy would increase in proportion
to the need for direction felt in the different groups to
which they belonged. Many of the scattered companies
too were so far from the tabernacle that they might
desire a worship of their own, and the original priestly
function of the heads of tribes, if it had lapsed, might
in this way be revived. Although there were no altars,
yet with censers and incense one of the highest rites
of worship might be observed.</p>

<p>Again, the period of inaction must have been galling
to many who conceived themselves quite capable of
making a successful assault on the inhabitants of
Canaan, or otherwise securing a settled place of abode
for Israel. And the tribe of Reuben, first by birthright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and apparently one of the strongest, would take
the lead in a movement to set aside the authority of
Moses. We have also to keep in mind that though
Moses had pressed the Kenizzites to join the march and
relied on their fidelity, the presence in the camp of
one like Hobab, who was an equal not a vassal of
Moses, must have been a continual incentive to disaffection.
He and his troops had their own notions,
we may believe, as to the delay of forty years, and
would very likely deny its necessity. They would also
have their own cultus, and religiously, as well as in
other ways, show an independence which encouraged
revolt.</p>

<p>Once more, as to the Levites, it might seem unfair
to them that Aaron and his two sons should have a
position so much higher than theirs. They had to
do many offices in connection with sacrifice, and other
parts of the holy service. On them, indeed, fell the
burden of the duties, and the ambitious might expect
to force their way into the higher office of the priesthood,
at a time when rebellion against authority was
coming to a head. We may suppose that Korah and
his company of Levites, acting partly for themselves,
partly in concert with the two hundred and fifty who
had already assumed the right to burn incense, agreed
to make their demand in the first instance, that as
Levites they should be admitted priests. This would
prepare the way for the princes of the tribes to claim
sacerdotal rights according to the old clan idea. And
at the same time, the priority of Reuben would be
another point, insistence upon which would strike at
the power of Moses. If the princes of Reuben had
gone so far as to erect a "tabernacle" or <i>mishcan</i> for
their worship, that may have been, for the occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
made the headquarters of revolt, perhaps because
Reuben happened at the time to be nearest the encampment
of the Levites.</p>

<p>A widespread rebellion, an organised rebellion, not
homogeneous, but with many elements in it tending
to utter confusion, is what we see. Suppose it to
have succeeded, the unity of worship would have been
destroyed completely. Each tribe with its own cultus
would have gone its own way so far as religion was
concerned. In a very short time there would have
been as many debased cults as there were wandering
companies. Then the claim of autonomy, if not of
right to lead the tribes, made on behalf of Reuben,
involved a further danger. Moses had not only the
sagacity but the inspiration which ought to have commanded
obedience. The princes of Reuben had neither.
Whether all under the lead of Reuben or each tribe
led by its own princes, the Israelites would have
travelled to disaster. Futile attempts at conquest, strife
or alliance with neighbouring peoples, internal dissension,
would have worn the tribes piecemeal away.
The dictatorship of Moses, the Aaronic priesthood, and
the unity of worship stood or fell together. One of
the three removed, the others would have given way.
But the revolutionary spirit, springing out of ambition
and a disaffection for which there was no excuse, was
blind to consequences. And the stern suppression of
this revolt, at whatever cost, was absolutely needful if
there was to be any future for Israel.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that we have in this rebellion
of Korah the first example of ecclesiastical dissension,
and that the punishment is a warning to all who presumptuously
intrude into the priestly office. Laymen
take the censer; and the fire of the Lord burns them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
up. So, let not laymen, at any time in the Church's
history, venture to touch the sacred mysteries. If
ritual and sacramentarian miracle were the heart of
religion; if there could be no worship of God and no
salvation for men now unless through a consecrated
priesthood, this might be said. But the old covenant,
with its symbols and shadows, has been superseded.
We have another centre now, another tabernacle,
another way which has been consecrated for ever by
the sacrifice of Christ, a way into the holiest of all open
to every believer. Our unity does not depend on the
priesthood of men, but on the universal and eternal
priesthood of Christ. The co-operation of Aaron as
priest was needful to Moses, not that his power might
be maintained for his own sake, but that he might have
authority over the host for Israel's sake. It was not
the dignity of an order or of a man that was at stake,
but the very existence of religion and of the nation.
This bond snapped at any point, the tribes would have
been scattered and lost.</p>

<p>A leader of men standing above them for their
temporal interests can rarely take upon him to be the
instrument of administering the penalty of their sins.
What king, for instance, ever invoked an interdict on
his own people, or in his own right of judging for God
condemned them to pay a tax to the Church, because
they had done what was morally wrong? Rulers
generally have regarded disobedience to themselves
as the only crime it was worth their while to punish.
When Moses stood against the faithless spirit of the
Israelites and issued orders by way of punishing that
bad spirit, he certainly put his authority to a tremendous
test. Without a sure ground of confidence in Divine
support, he would have been foolhardy in the extreme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
And we are not surprised that the coalition against
him represented many causes of discontent. Under
his administration the long sojourn in the desert had
been decreed, and a whole generation deprived of what
they held their right&mdash;a settlement in Canaan. He
appeared to be tyrannising over the tribes; and proud
Reubenites sought to put an end to his rule. The
priesthood was his creation, and seemed to be made
exclusive simply that through Aaron he might have a
firmer hold of the people's liberties. Why was the
old prerogative of the headmen in religious matters
taken from them? They would reclaim their rights.
Neither Levi nor Reuben should be denied its priestly
autonomy any longer. In the whole rebellion there
was one spirit, but there were also divided counsels;
and Moses showed his wisdom by taking the revolt
not as a single movement, but part by part.</p>

<p>First he met the Levites, with Korah at their head,
professing great zeal for the principle that all the
congregation were holy, every one of them. A claim
made on that ground could not be disproved by
argument, perhaps, although the holiness of the congregation
was evidently an ideal, not a fact. Jehovah
Himself would have to decide. Yet Moses remonstrated
in a way that was fitted to move the Levites, and
perhaps did touch some of them. They had been
honoured by God in having a certain holy office
assigned to them. Were they to renounce it in joining
a revolt which would make the very priesthood
they desired common to all the tribes? From Jehovah
Himself the Levites had their commission. It was
against Jehovah they were fighting; and how could
they speed? They spoke of Aaron and his dignity.
But what was Aaron? Only a servant of God and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the people, a man who personally assumed no great
airs. By this appeal some would seem to have
been detached from the rebellion, for in xxvi. 9-11,
when the judgment of Korah and his company is
referred to, it is added, "Notwithstanding the children
of Korah died not." From 1 Chron. vi. we learn that
in the line of Korah's descendants appeared certain
makers and leaders of sacred song, Heman among
them, one of David's singers, to whom Psalm lxxxviii.
is ascribed.</p>

<p>With the Reubenites Moses deals in the next place,
taking their cause of discontent by itself. Already
one of the three Reubenite chiefs had withdrawn, and
Dathan and Abiram stood by themselves. Refusing
to obey the call of Moses to a conference, they stated
their grievance roughly by the mouth of a messenger;
and Moses could only with indignation express before
God his blamelessness in regard to them: "I have
not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one
of them." Neither for his own enrichment, nor in
personal ambition had he acted. Could they maintain,
did the people think, that the present revolt was
equally disinterested? Under cover of opposition to
tyranny, are they not desiring to play the part of
tyrants and aggrandise themselves at the expense of
the people?</p>

<p>It is singular that not a word is said in special
condemnation of the two hundred and fifty because
they were in possession of censers and incense. May
it be the case that the complete reservation of the
high-priestly duties to the house of Aaron had not as
yet taken effect, that it was a purpose rather than a
fact? May it not further be the case that the rebellion
partly took form and ripened because an order had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
been given withdrawing the use of censers from the
headmen of the tribes? If there had as yet been a
certain temporary allowance of the tribal priesthood
and ritual, we should not have to ask how incense and
censers were in the hands of the two hundred and fifty,
and why the brass of their vessels was held to be
sacred and put to holy use.</p>

<p>The prayer of Moses in which he interceded for the
people, ver. 22, is marked by an expression of singular
breadth, "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh."
The men, misled on the fleshly side by appetite (ver. 13),
and shrinking from pain, were against God. But their
spirits were in His hand. Would He not move their
spirits, redeem and save them? Would He not look
on the hearts of all and distinguish the guilty from
the innocent, the more rebellious from the less? One
man had sinned, but would God burst out on the
whole congregation? The form of the intercession
is abrupt, crude. Even Moses with all his justice and
all his pity could not be more just, more compassionate,
than Jehovah. The purpose of destruction was not as
the leader thought it to be.</p>

<p>Regarding the judgments, that of the earthquake and
that of the fire, we are too remote in time to form any
proper conception of what they were, how they were
inflicted. "Moses," says Lange, "appears as a man
whose wonderful presentiment becomes a miraculous
prophecy by the Spirit of revelation." But this is not
sufficient. There was more than a presentiment.
Moses knew what was coming, knew that where the
rebels stood the earth would open, the consuming fire
burn. The plague, on the other hand, which next day
spread rapidly among the excited people and threatened
to destroy them, was not foreseen. It came as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
straight from the hand of Divine wrath. But it afforded
an opportunity for Aaron to prove his power with
God and his courage. Carrying the sacred fire into
the midst of the infected people he became the means
of their deliverance. As he waved his censer, and its
fumes went up to heaven, faith in Jehovah and in
Aaron as the true priest of Jehovah was revived in the
hearts of men. Their spirits came again under the
healing power of that symbolism which had lost its
virtue in common use, and was now associated in a
grave crisis with an appeal to Him who smites and
heals, who kills and makes alive.</p>

<p>It has been maintained by some that the closing
sentences of chap. xvii. should follow chap. xvi. with
which they appear to be closely connected, the incident
of the budding of Aaron's rod seeming to call rather for
a festal celebration than a lament. The theory of the
Book of Numbers we have seen reason to adopt would
account for the introduction of the fresh episode, simply
because it relates to the priesthood and tends to confirm
the Aaronites in exclusive dignity. The symbolic
test of the claim raised by the tribes corresponds
closely to the signs that were used by some of the
prophets, such as the girdle laid up by the river
Euphrates, and the basket of summer fruits. The rod
on which Aaron's name was written was of almond, a
tree for which Syria was famous. Like the sloe it
sends forth blossoms before the leaves; and the unique
way in which this twig showed its living vigour as
compared with the others was a token of the choice
of Levi to serve and Aaron to minister in the holiest
office before Jehovah.</p>

<p>The whole circumstances, and the closing cry of the
people, leave the impression of a grave difficulty found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
in establishing the hierarchy and centralising the
worship. It was a necessity&mdash;shall we call it a sad
necessity?&mdash;that the men of the tribes should be
deprived of direct access to the sanctuary and the
oracle. Earthly, disobedient, and far from trustful in
God, they could not be allowed, even the hereditary
chiefs among them, to offer sacrifices. The ideas of
the Divine holiness embodied in the Mosaic law were
so far in advance of the common thought of Israel,
that the old order had to be superseded by one fitted
to promote the spiritual education of the people, and
prepare them for a time when there shall be "on the
bells of the horses, <span class="smcap">Holy unto the Lord</span>; and every
pot in Judah shall be holy unto the Lord of hosts,
and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them
and seethe therein." The institution of the Aaronic
priesthood was a step of progress indispensable to the
security of religion and the brotherhood of the tribes
in that high sense for which they were made a nation.
But it was at the same time a confession that Israel
was not spiritual, was not the holy congregation Korah
declared it to be. The greater was the pity that afterwards
in the day of Israel's opportunity, when Christ
came to lead the whole people into the spiritual liberty
and grace for which prophets had longed, the priestly
system was held tenaciously as the pride of the nation.
When the law of ritual and sacrifice and priestly
mediation should have been left behind as no longer
necessary because the Messiah had come, the way of
higher life was opened in vain. Sacerdotalism held its
place with full consent of those who guided affairs.
Israel as a nation was blinded, and its day shone in
vain.</p>

<p>Of all priesthoods as corporate bodies, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
estimable, zealous, and spiritually-minded individual
members of them may be, must it not be said that their
existence is a sad necessity? They may be educative.
A sacerdotal system now may, like that of the Mosaic
law, be a tutor to bring men to Christ. Realising that,
those who hold office under it may bring help to men
not yet fit for liberty. But priestly dominance is no perpetual
rule in any church, certainly not in the Kingdom
of God. The freedom with which Christ makes men
free is the goal. The highest duty a priest can fulfil
is to prepare men for that liberty; and as soon as he
can he should discharge them for the enjoyment of it.
To find in episodes like those of Korah's revolt and its
suppression a rule applicable to modern religious affairs
is too great an anachronism. For whatever right
sacerdotalism now has is purely of the Church's tolerance,
in the measure not of Divine right, but of the
need of uninstructed men. To the spiritual, to those
who know, the priestly system with its symbols and
authoritative claim is but an interference with privilege
and duty.</p>

<p>Can any Aaron now make an atonement for a mass
of people, or even in virtue of his office apply to
them the atonement made by Christ? How does his
absolution help a soul that knows Christ the Redeemer
as every Christian soul ought to know Him? The
great fault of priesthoods always is, that having once
gained power, they endeavour to retain it and extend
it, making greater claims the longer they exist.
Affirming that they speak for the Church, they
endeavour to control the voice of the Church. Affirming
that they speak for Christ, they deny or minimise
His great gift of liberty. Freedom of thought and
reason was to Cardinal Newman, for example, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
cause of all deplorable heresies and infidelities, of a
divided Church and a ruined world. The candid priest
of our day is found making his claim as largely as
ever, and then virtually explaining it away. Should
not the vain attempt to hold by Judaic institutions
cease? And although the Church of Christ early
made the mistake of harking back to Mosaism, should
not confession now be made that priesthood of the
exclusive kind is out of date, that every believer may
perform the highest functions of the consecrated life?</p>

<p>The Divine choice of Aaron, his confirmation in high
religious office by the budding of the almond twig as
well as by the acceptance of his intercession, have their
parallels now. The realities of one age become symbols
for another. Like the whole ritual of Israel, these
particular incidents may be turned to Christian use by
way of illustration. But not with regard to the prerogative
of any arch-hierarch. The availing intercession
is that of Christ, the sole headship over the tribes of
men is that which He has gained by Divine courage,
love, and sacrifice. Among those who believe there is
equal dependence on the work of Christ. When we
come to intercession which they make for each other,
it is of value in consideration not of office but of faith.
"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much." It is as "righteous" men, humble
men, not as priests they prevail. The sacraments are
efficacious, "not from any virtue in them or in him
that administers them," but through faith, by the energy
of the omnipresent Spirit.</p>

<p>Yet there are men chosen to special duty, whose
almond twigs bud and blossom and become their
sceptres. Appointment and ordination are our expedients;
grace is given by God in a higher line of calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and endowment. While there are blessings pronounced
that fall upon the ear or gratify the sensibility, theirs
reach the soul. For them the world has need to thank
God. They keep religion alive, and make it bourgeon
and yield the new fruits for which the generations
hunger. They are new branches of the Living Vine.
Of them it has often to be said, as of the Lord Himself,
"The stone which the builders rejected the same has
become head of the corner; this is the Lord's doing,
and it is marvellous in our eyes."</p>

<h2>XV<br /><br />

<i>TITHES AND CLEANSINGS</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xviii., xix</h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Duties and Support of the Ministry.</span>&mdash;The
statutes of chap. xviii. are related to the rebellion
of Korah by a clause in ver. 9, "Ye shall keep the
charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar:
that there be wrath no more upon the children of
Israel." The enactments are directed anew against
any intrusion into the sacred service by those who are
not Levites, and into the priesthood by those who are
not Aaronites. It is clearly implied that the ministry
of the tabernacle is held under a grave responsibility.
The "iniquity of the sanctuary" and the "iniquity of
the priesthood" have to be borne; and the Aaronites
alone are commissioned to bear that iniquity. The
Levites, though they serve, are not to touch the holy
vessels lest they die. The priesthood, "for everything
of the altar, and for that within the veil," is given to
the Aaronites as a service of gift.</p>

<p>A certain "iniquity," corresponding to the holiness
of the tabernacle and its vessels, attends the service
which is to be done by the priests. Their entrance
into the sacred tent is an approach to Jehovah, and
from His purity there is thrown a defilement on human
life. The idea thus represented is capable of fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
spiritual realisation. With this embodied in the law
and worship, there is no need to look in any other
direction for that evangelical poverty of spirit which
the better Israelites of an after time knew. Here
prophecy found in the law a germ of deep religious
feeling which, rising above tabernacle and altar, became
the holy fear of Him who inhabits eternity. The
creation throughout its whole range, in the very act
of receiving existence, comes into contrast with the
creative Will and is on a lower moral plane, to which
the Divine purity does not accompany it. The seraphim
of Isaiah's vision feel this severance to a certain extent.
They are so far apart from God that His holiness is
not enjoyed unconsciously, as the element of life. It
shines above them and determines their attitude and
the terms of their praise. With their wings they cover
their faces, and they cry to each other, "Holy, holy,
holy is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of
His glory." Even they "bear the iniquity" of the great
temple of the world in which they minister. On fallen
man that iniquity lies with almost crushing weight.
"Woe is me!" says the prophet, "for I am undone;
because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the
midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have
seen the King, Jehovah of hosts." Thus the soul is
brought into that profound consciousness of defect and
pollution which is the preparation for reverent service
of the Highest. The attribute of holiness remains with
God always, and His mercy in forgiving sin in no way
detracts from it. The eternity of God sets Him so far
above transitory men that He can extend compassion
to them. "Art Thou not from everlasting, O Jehovah
my God, mine Holy One? We shall not die." But
His touch is, to the sinful earth, almost destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
When the Lord the God of hosts toucheth the land it
melteth, and all that dwell therein mourn (Amos ix. 12).
When a people falls from righteousness the Divine
holiness burns against it like a consuming fire. "We
are all become as one that is unclean, and all our
righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we
all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities like the wind
take us away.... Thou hast hid Thy face from us,
and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities"
(Isa. lxiv. 6, 7).</p>

<p>The idea of the identification with the Holy God of
the sanctuary dedicated to Him, so that from the porch
of it falls the shadow of iniquity, is still further carried
out in Numb. xviii. 1, where it is declared that Aaron
and his sons shall "bear the iniquity" of their priesthood.
The meaning is that the priesthood as an
abstract thing, an office held from Jehovah and for
Him, has a holiness like the sanctuary, and that the
entrance into it of a man like Aaron brings to light
his human imperfection and taint. And this corresponds
to a consciousness which every one who deals
with sacred truth and undertakes the conduct of
Divine worship in the right spirit is bound to have.
Entering on those exalted duties he "bears his iniquity."
The sense of daring intrusion may almost
keep back a man who knows that he has received a
Divine call.</p>

<p>To the heavenly muse the poet can but reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am not worthy even to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of Thy prevailing mysteries;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For I am but an earthly muse ...<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And darken sanctities with song."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With regard to the Levites whom Aaron is to bring
near "that they may be joined unto him," it is singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
that their duties and the restrictions put on them are
detailed here as if now for the first time this branch
of the sacred ministry was being organised. In the
actual development of things this may be true. Difficulties
had to be overcome, the nature of the statutes
and ordinances had to be explained. Now the time of
practical initiation may have arrived. On the other
hand, the attempt of Korah to press into the priesthood
may have made necessary a recapitulation of the law of
Levitical service.</p>

<p>For the support of the Aaronites the heave offerings,
"even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel"
were to be given "by reason of the anointing." The
meal offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings, as
most holy, were to be for the male Aaronites alone:
heave offerings of sacrifice, again, "all the wave offerings,"
were to be used by the Aaronites and their
families, the reservation being made that only those
without ceremonial defilement should eat of them.
The first-fruits of the oil and vintage and the first
ripe of all fruits in the land were other perquisites.
Further, the first-born of man and of beast were to be
nominally devoted; but first-born children were to be
redeemed for five shekels, and the firstlings of unclean
beasts were also to be redeemed. The children of
Aaron were to have no inheritance in the land. In
these ways however, and by the payment to the priests
of the tenth part of the tithes collected by the Levites,
ample provision was made for them.</p>

<p>For the Levites, nine-tenths of all tithes of produce
would appear to have been not only sufficient, but far
more than their proportion. According to the numbers
reported in this book, twenty-two thousand Levites&mdash;about
twelve thousand of them adult men&mdash;were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
receive tithes from six hundred thousand. This would
make the provision for the Levite as much as for any
five men of the tribes. An explanation is suggested
that the regular payment of tithes could not be
reckoned upon. There would always be Israelites
who resented an obligation like this; and as the duty
of paying tithes, though enjoined in the law, was a
moral one, not enforced by penalty, the Levites were
really in many periods of the history of Israel in a
state of poverty. It was a complaint of Malachi even
after the captivity, when the law was in force, that the
tithes were not brought to the temple storehouses.
The Deuteronomic laws of tithing, moreover, are different
from those given in Numbers. While here we read
of a single tithe which is to be for the Levites, which,
if paid, would be more than sufficient for them,
Deuteronomy speaks of an annual tithe of produce
to be eaten by the people at the central sanctuary by
way of a festival, to which children, servants, and
Levites were to be invited. Each third year a special
tithe was to be used in feasting, not necessarily at the
sanctuary, and again the Levites were to have their
share. It is supposed by some that there were two
annual tithings and in the third year three tithings of
the produce of the land. But this seems far more than
even a specially fertile country could bear. There was
no rent to be paid, of course; and if the tithes were
used in a festival no great difficulty might be found.
But it is clear at all events that more dependence was
placed on the free will of the people than on the law; and
the Levites and priests must have suffered when religion
fell into neglect. Israel was not ideally generous.</p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">Water of Purification.</span>&mdash;The statute of xix.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
1-22 is peculiar, and the rites it enjoins are full of
symbolism. It is implied that water alone was unable
to remove the defilement caused by touching a dead
body; but at the same time the taint was so common
and might be incurred so far from the sanctuary that
sacrifice could not always be exacted. In order to
meet the case an animal was to be offered, and the
residue of its burning was to be kept for use whenever
the defilement of death had to be taken away.</p>

<p>A red heifer was to be chosen, the colour of the
animal pointing to the hue of blood. The heifer was
to be free from blemish, a type of vigorous and prolific
life. The charge of the sacrifice was to be given to
Eleazar the priest, for the high-priest himself might
not undertake a duty the performance of which caused
uncleanness. The ceremonies must take place not only
outside the tabernacle court, but outside the camp, that
the intensity of the uncleanness to be transferred to
the animal and purged by the sacrifice may be clearly
understood. The heifer being slain, the priest takes
of its blood and sprinkles it towards the tent of meeting
seven times, in lieu of the ordinary sprinkling on the
altar. The whole animal is then burnt, and while the
flame ascends the virtue of the residuent ashes is
symbolically increased by certain other elements. These
are cedar wood, which was believed to have special
medicinal qualities, and also may have been chosen on
account of the long life of the tree; some threads of
scarlet wool which would represent the arterial blood,
instinct with vital power; and hyssop which was
employed in purification.</p>

<p>The priest, having presided at the sacrifice, was to
wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh and hold
himself unclean till the even. The assistant who fed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the fire was in like manner unclean. These were both
to withdraw; and one who was clean was to gather the
ashes of the burning and, having provided some clean
vessel within the camp, he was to store up the purifying
ashes for future use by the people. Finally, the person
who did this last duty, having become tainted like the
others, was to wash his clothes and be unclean for the
day. The ashes were to be used by mixing them with
water to make "water for pollution"; that is, water to
take away pollution. Special care was to be exercised
that only living water, or water from a flowing stream,
should be used for this purpose. It was to be applied
to the defiled person, vessel, or tent, by means of
hyssop. But, again, the man who used the water of
purification in this way was to wash his clothes and
be unclean until even.</p>

<p>Here we have an extra-sacerdotal rite, not of worship&mdash;for
as ordinarily used there was no prayer to God,
nor perhaps even the thought of appeal to God. It
was religious, for the sense of defilement belonged to
religion; but when under the necessity of the occasion
any one applied the water of purification, his sense of
acting the priestly part was reduced to the lowest
point. The efficacy came through the action of the
accredited priest when the heifer was sacrificed, it might
be a year previously. So, although provision was
made for needs occurring far from the sanctuary, no
opening was left for any one to claim the power belonging
to the sacerdotal office. And in order to make this
still more sure it was enacted (ver. 21), that though
the sprinkled water of purification cleansed the unclean,
any one who touched it being himself clean should
<i>de facto</i> be defiled. The water was declared so sacred
that unless in cases where it was really required no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
one would be disposed to meddle with it. The sanctity
of the tabernacle and the priesthood was symbolically
carried forth to the most distant parts of the land. All
were to be on their guard lest they should incur the
judgment of God by abusing that which had ceremonial
holiness and power.</p>

<p>The idea here is in a sense directly opposite to that
which we associate with the sacred word, by which
Divine will is communicated and souls are begotten
anew. To use that word, to make it known abroad is
the duty of every one who has heard and believed.
He diffuses blessing and is himself blessed. There is
no strict law hedging about with precautions the happy
privilege of conveying to the sin-defiled the message
of forgiveness and life. And yet may we not call to
recollection here the words of Paul, "I buffet my body,
and bring it into bondage; lest by any means, after
that I have preached to others, I myself should be
rejected." In a spiritual sense they should be clean
who bear the vessels of the Lord; and every deed
done, every word spoken in the sacred Name, if not
with purity of purpose and singleness of heart, involves
in guilt him who acts and speaks. The privilege has
its accompanying danger; and the more widely it is
used in the thousand organisations within and without
the Church, the more carefully do all who use it need
to guard the sanctity of the message and the Name.
"In a great house there are not only vessels of gold
and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some
unto honour, and some unto dishonour. If a man therefore
purge himself from these"&mdash;the profane babblings
of those who do not handle the word of God aright&mdash;"he
shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, meet
for the Master's use, prepared unto every good work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">Defilement by the Dead.</span>&mdash;The statute of the
water of purification stands closely related to one form
of uncleanness, that occasioned by death. When death
took place in a tent, every one who came into the tent
and every one who was in the tent, every open vessel
that had no covering bound upon it, and the tent itself
(ver. 18) were defiled; and the taint could not be
removed in less than seven days. Whoever in the
open field touched one who had been slain with a
sword, or had otherwise died, or touched the bone of
a man, or a grave&mdash;contracted like defilement. For
purification the sacred water had to be sprinkled on
the defiled person, on the third day and again on the
seventh day. Not only the aspersion with sacred
water, but, in addition, cleansing of clothes and of the
body was necessary, in order to complete the removal
of the taint. And further, while any one was unclean
from this cause, if he touched another, his touch carried
defilement that continued to the close of the day.
To neglect the statute of purification was to defile the
tabernacle of Jehovah: he who did so was to be cut
off from his people.</p>

<p>The law was made stringent, as we have already
seen, partly no doubt for the purpose of preventing
the spread of disease. And to that extent the preservation
of health was presented as a religious duty; for
only in that sense can we understand the statement
that he who did not purify himself defiled the tabernacle
of Jehovah. Yet the stringency cannot be altogether
due to this, for a bone or a grave would not often
communicate infection. The general principle must
be received by way of explanation, that death is peculiarly
repugnant to the life of God, and therefore
contact with it, in any form, takes away the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
approach to the sanctuary. That this idea goes back
to the fall and the death penalty then pronounced
might seem a reasonable conclusion. But the same
thought does not apply to the defilement connected
with birth. If the statute regarding uncleanness by
death rested on the connection of death with sin, making
"death and mortal corruption an embodiment of sin,"
the thought was obscured by many other laws regarding
uncleanness. The aim we must believe was to
make the theocratic oversight of the people penetrate
as many as possible of the incidents and contingencies
of their existence.</p>

<h2>XVI<br /><br />

<i>SORROW AND FAILURE AT KADESH</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xx</h4>

<p>There is a mustering at Kadesh of the scattered
tribes, for now the end of the period of wandering
approaches, and the generation that has been
disciplined in the wilderness must prepare for a new
advance. The spies who searched Canaan were sent
from Kadesh (xiii. 26), to which, in the second year
from the exodus, the tribes had penetrated. Now, in
the first month of the fortieth year it would seem,
Kadesh is again the headquarters. The adjacent
district is called the desert of Zin. Eastward, across
the great plain of the Arabah, reaching from the Dead
Sea to the Elanitic Gulf, are the mountains of Seir,
the natural rampart of Edom. To the head of the
Gulf at Elath the distance is some eighty miles in a
straight line southward; to the southern end of the
Dead Sea it is about fifty miles. Kadesh is almost
upon the southern border of Canaan; but the way of
the Negeb is barred by defeat, and Israel must enter
the Promised Land by another route. In preparation for
the advance the tribes gather from the wadies and plateaus
in which they have been wandering, and at Kadesh
or near it the earlier incidents of this chapter occur.</p>

<p>First among them is the death of Miriam. She has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
survived the hardships of the desert and reached a
very great age. Her time of influence and vigour
past, all the joys of life now in the dim memories of
a century, she is glad, no doubt, when the call comes.
It was her happiness once to share the enthusiasm of
Moses and to sustain the faith of the people in their
leader and in God. But any service of this kind she
could render has been left behind. For some time she
has been able only now and then with feeble steps to
move to the tent of meeting that she might assure
herself of the welfare of Moses. The tribes will press
on to Canaan, but she shall never see it.</p>

<p>How is a life like this of Miriam's to be reckoned?
Take into account her faith and her faithfulness; but
remember that both were maintained with some intermixture
of poor egotism; that while she helped Moses
she also claimed to rival and rebuke him; that while
she served Jehovah it was with some of the pride of a
prophetess. Her devotion, her endurance, the long
interest in her brother's work, which indeed led to the
great error of her life&mdash;these were her virtues, the old
great virtues of a woman. So far as opportunity went
she doubtless did her utmost, with some independence
of thought and decision of character. Even though
she gave way to jealousy and passed beyond her
right, we must believe that, on the whole, she served
her generation in loyalty to the best she knew, and
in the fear of the Most High. But into what a
strange disturbed current of life was her effort thrown!
Downcast, sorely burdened women, counting for very
little when they were cheerful or when they complained,
heard Miriam's words and took them into their narrow
thoughts, to resent her enthusiasm, perhaps, when she
was enthusiastic, to grudge her the power she enjoyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
which to herself seemed so slight. In the camp
generally she had respect, and perhaps, once and again,
she was able to reconcile to Moses and to one another
those whose quarrels threatened the common peace.
When she was put forth from the camp in the shame
of her leprosy, all were affected, and the march was
stayed till her time of separation was over. Was she
one of those women whose lot it is to serve others
all their lives and to have little for their service? Still,
like many another, she helped to make Israel. Of
good and evil, of Divine elements and some that are
anything but Divine, lives are made up. And although
we cannot gather the results of any one and tell its
worth, the stream of being retains and the unerring
judgment of God accepts whatever is sincere and
good. Miriam from first to last fills but a few lines
of sacred history; yet of her life, as of others, more
has to be told; the end did not come when she died
at Kadesh and was buried outside Canaan.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Spread through a diversified and not altogether
barren region, over many square miles, the tribes have
been able during the thirty-seven years to provide
themselves with water. Gathered more closely now,
when the dry season begins they are in want. And
at once complaints are renewed. Nor can we wonder
much. In flaming sunshine, in the parched air of the
heights and the stifling heat of the narrow valleys, the
cattle gasping and many of them dying, the children
crying in vain for water, the little that is to be had, hot
and almost putrid, carefully divided, yet insufficient to
give each family a little,&mdash;the people might well lament
their apparently inevitable fate. It may be said, "They
should have confided in God." But while that might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
apply in ordinary circumstances, would not be out of
place if the whole history were ideal, the reality, once
understood, forbids so easy a condemnation of unbelief.
Nothing is more terrible to endure, nothing more fitted
to make strong men weep or turn them into savage
critics of a leader and of Providence, than to see their
children in the extremity of want which they cannot
relieve. And a leader like Moses, patient as he may
have been of other complaints, should have been most
patient of this. When the people chode with him and
said, "Would God that we had died when our brethren
died before the Lord! And why have ye brought the
assembly of the Lord into this wilderness, that we
should die, we and our cattle?" they ought surely to
have been met with pity and soothing words.</p>

<p>It is indeed a tragedy we are to witness when we
come to the rock; and one element of it is the old age
and the weary spirit of the leader. Who can tell what
vexed his soul that day? how many cares and anxieties
burdened the mind that was clear yet, but not so
tolerant, perhaps, as once it had been? The years of
Moses, his long and arduous service of the people, are
not remembered as they ought to be. Even in their
extremity the men of the tribes ought to have appealed
to their great chief with all respect, instead of breaking
in upon him with reproaches. Was no experience
sufficient for these people? After the discipline of the
wilderness, was the new generation, like that which
had died, still a mere horde, ungrateful, rebellious?
From the leader's point of view this thought could not
fail to arise, and the old magnanimity did not drive it
away.</p>

<p>Another point is the forbearance of Jehovah, who
has no anger with the people. The Divine Voice commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Moses to take his rod and go forth to the rock
and speak to it before the assembly. This does not
fall in with Moses' mood. Why is God not indignant
with the men of this new generation who seize the first
opportunity to begin their murmuring? Relapsing
from his high inspiration to a poor human level, Moses
begins to think that Jehovah, whose forgiveness he has
often implored on Israel's behalf, is too ready now to
forgive. It is a failing of the best men thus to stand
for the prerogative of God more than God Himself;
that is, to mistake the real point of the circumstances
they judge and the Divine will they should interpret.
The story of Jonah shows the prophet anxious that
Nineveh, the inveterate foe of Israel, the centre of
proud, God-defying idolatry, should be destroyed.
Does God wish it to be spared, to repent and obtain
forgiveness? So does not Jonah. His creed is one
of doom for wickedness. He resents the Divine mercy
and, in effect, exalts himself above the Most High. In
like temper is Moses when he goes out followed by the
crowd. There is the rock from which water shall be
made to flow. But with the thought in his mind that
the people do not deserve God's help, Moses takes the
affair upon himself. The tragedy is fulfilled when his
own feelings guide him more than the Divine patience,
his own displeasure more than the Divine compassion;
and with the words on his lips, "Hear now, ye rebels;
shall we bring you forth water out of this rock?" he
smites it twice with his rod.</p>

<p>For the moment, forgetting Jehovah the merciful,
Moses will himself act God; and he misrepresents God,
dishonours God, as every one who forgets Him is sure
to do. Is he confident in the power of his wonder-working
rod? Does he wish to show that its old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
virtue remains? He will use it as if he were smiting
the people as well as the rock. Is he willing that this
thirsting multitude should drink? Yet he is determined
to make them feel that they offend by the urgency with
which they press upon him for help. There have been
crises in the lives of leaders of men when, with all the
teaching of the past to inspire them, they should have
risen to a faith in God far greater than they ever
exercised before; and more or less they have failed.
This is not the will of Providence, they have thought,
though they should have known that it was. They
have said, "Advance: but God goes not with you,"
when they should have seen the heavenly light moving
on. So Moses failed. He touched his limit; and it was
far short of that breadth of compassion which belongs
to the Most Merciful. He stood as God, with the rod
in his hand to give the water, but with the condemnation
upon his lips which Jehovah did not speak.</p>

<p>In this mood of assumed majesty, of moral indignation
which has a personal source, with an air of superiority
not the simplicity of inspiration, a man may do what
he will for ever regret, may betray a habit of self-esteem
which has been growing upon him and will be
his ruin if it is not checked. In the strong mind of
Moses there had lain the germs of hauteur. The early
upbringing in an Egyptian court could not fail to leave
its mark, and the dignity of a dictator could not
be sustained, after the anxieties of the first two
years in the desert, without some slight growth of a
tendency or disposition to look down on people so spiritless,
and play among them the part of Providence, the
decrees of which Moses had so often interpreted. But
pride, even beginning to show itself towards men, is
an aping of God. Unconsciously the mind that looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
down on the crowd falls into the trick of a superhuman
claim. Moses, great as he is, without personal ambition,
the friend of every Israelite, reaches unaware
the hour when a habit long suppressed lifts itself into
power. He feels himself the guardian of justice, a
critic not only of the lives of men but of the attitude of
Jehovah towards them. It is but for an hour; yet the
evil is done. What appears to the uplifted mind justice,
is arrogance. What is meant for a defence of Jehovah's
right, is desecration of the highest office a man can
hold under the Supreme. The words are spoken, the
rock is struck in pride; and Moses has fallen.</p>

<p>Think of the realisation of this which comes when
the flush of hasty resentment dies, and the true self
which had been suppressed revives in humble thought.
"What have I done?" is the reflection&mdash;"What have
I said? My rod, my hand, my will, what are they?
My indignation! Who gave me the right to be indignant?
A king against whom they have revolted!
A guardian of the Divine honour! Alas! I have denied
Jehovah. I, who stood for Him in my pride, have
defamed Him in my vanity. The people who murmured,
whom I rebuked, have sinned less than I. They distrusted
God, I have declared Him unmerciful, and
thereby sown the seeds of distrust. Now I, too, am
barred from Israel's inheritance. Unworthy of the
promise, I shall never cross the border of God's land.
Aaron my brother, we are the transgressors. Because
we have not honoured God to sanctify Him in the eyes
of the children of Israel, therefore we shall not bring
this assembly unto the land He gives them." By the
lips of Moses himself the oracle was given. It was
tragical indeed.</p>

<p>But how could the brothers who had yielded to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
dictatorial hierarchical temper be men of God again,
fit for another stroke of work for Him, unless, coming
forth into action, their pride had disclosed itself, and
with whatever bad result shown its real nature? We
deplore the pride; we almost weep to see its manifestation;
we hear with sorrow the judgment of Moses
and Aaron. But well is it that the worst should come
to light, that the evil thing should be seen, God-dishonoring,
sacrilegious; should be judged, repented
of, punished. Moses must "feel himself and find the
blessedness of being little." "By that sin fell the angels,"
that sin unconfessed. Here in open sight of all, in hearing
of all, Moses lays down the godhead he had assumed,
acknowledges unworthiness, takes his place humbly
among those who shall not inherit the promise. The
worst of all happens to a man when his pride remains
unrevealed, uncondemned; grows to more and more,
and he never discovers that he is attempting to carry
himself with the air of Providence, of Divinity.</p>

<p>The error of Moses was great, yet only showed him
to be a man of like passions with ourselves. Who
can realise the mercy and lovingkindness that are
in the heart of God, the danger of limiting the Holy
One of Israel? The murmuring of the Israelites
against Jehovah had often been rebuked, had often
brought them into condemnation. Moses had once
and again intervened as their mediator and saved
them from death. Remembering the times when
he had to speak of Jehovah's anger, he feels himself
justified in his own resentment. He thought the
murmuring was over; it is resumed unexpectedly,
the same old complaints are made and he is carried
away by what appears zeal for Jehovah. Yet there
is in him even, the man, much more in God, a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
than the seeming best. Pathetic indeed is it to find
Moses judged as one who has failed from the high
place he could have reached by a final effort of self-mastery,
one more generous thought. And we see
him fail at a point where we often fail. Sternly to
judge our own right of condemning before we speak
sternly in the name of God; neither to do nor say
anything which implies the assumption of knowledge,
justice, charity we do not possess&mdash;how few of us are
in these respects blameless for a day! Far back in
sacred history this high duty is presented so as to
evoke the best endeavour of the Christian soul and
warn it from the place of failure.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>There is preserved in the Book of Exodus (xxxvi.)
a list of the Kings of Edom reaching down apparently
to about the establishment of the monarchy of Israel.
Recent archæology sees no reason to question the
genuineness of this historical notice or the names of
the Dukes of Edom given in the same passage. With
varying boundaries the region over which they ruled
extended southward from Moab and the Dead Sea as
far as the Elanitic Gulf. Kadesh, considerably west
of the Arabah, is described as being on its uttermost
border. But the district inhabited by the Edomites
proper was a narrow strip of rugged country eastward
of the range of Mount Seir. One pass giving entrance
to the heart of Edom led by the base of Mount Hor
towards Selah, afterwards called Petra, which occupied
a fine but narrow valley in the heart of broken
mountains. To reach the south of Moab the Israelites
desired probably to take a road a good deal farther
north. But this would have led them by Bozrah the
capital, and the king who reigned at the time refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
them the route. The message sent him in Moses'
name was friendly, even appealing. The brotherhood
of Edom and Israel was claimed; the sore travail of
the tribes in Egypt and the deliverance wrought by
Jehovah were given as reasons; promise was made
that no harm should be done to field or vineyard:
Israel would journey by the king's way turning neither
to the right nor the left. When the first request was
refused Moses added that if his people drank of the
water while passing through Edom they would pay
for it. The appeal, however, was made in vain. An
attempt to advance without permission was repelled.
An armed force barred the way, and most reluctantly
the desert road was again taken.</p>

<p>We can easily understand the objection of the King
of Edom. Many of the defiles through which the main
road wound were not adapted for the march of a great
multitude. The Israelites could scarcely have gone
through Edom without injuring the fields and vineyards;
and though the undertaking was given in good
faith by Moses, how could he answer for the whole
of that undisciplined host he was leading towards
Canaan? The safety of Edom lay in denying to other
peoples access to its strongholds. The difficulty of
approaching them was their main security. Israel
might go quietly through the land now; but its armies
might soon return with hostile intent. Water, too, was
very precious in some parts of Edom. Enough was
stored in the rainy season to supply the wants of the
inhabitants; beyond that there was none to spare,
and for this necessary of life money was no equivalent.
A multitude travelling with cattle would
have made scarcity, or famine,&mdash;might have left the
region almost desolate. With the information they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
had, Moses and Joshua may have believed that there
were no insuperable difficulties. Yet the best generalship
might have been unequal to the task of controlling
Israel in the passes and among the cultivated
fields of that singular country.</p>

<p>There is no need to go back on the history of Jacob
and Esau in order to account for the apparent incivility
of the King of Edom to the Israelites and Moses. That
quarrel had surely been long forgotten! But we need
not wonder if the kinship of the two peoples was no
availing argument in the case. Those were not times
when covenants like that proposed could be easily
trusted, nor was Israel on an expedition the nature
of which could reassure the Idumæans. And we have
parallels enough in modern life to show that from the
only point of view the king could take he was amply
justified. There are demands men make on others
without perceiving how difficult it will be to grant
them, demands on time, on means, on goodwill,
demands that would involve moral as well as material
sacrifice. The foolish intrusions of well-meaning
people may be borne for a time, but there is a limit
beyond which they cannot be suffered. Our whole
life cannot be exposed to the derangements of every
scheme-maker, every claimant. If we are to do our
own work well, it is absolutely necessary that a certain
space shall be jealously guarded, where the gains of
thought may be kept safely and the ideas revealed to us
may be developed. That any one's life should be open
so that travellers, even with some right of close
fraternity, may pass through the midst of it, drink of
the wells, and trample down the fields of growing
purpose or ripening thought, this is not required.
Good-will makes an open gate; Christian feeling makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
one still wider and bids many welcome. But he who
would keep his heart in fruitfulness must be careful
to whom he grants admission. There is beginning to
be a sort of jealousy of any one's right to his own
reserve. It is not a single Israel approaching from the
West, but a score, with their different schemes, who
come from every side demanding right of way and
even of abode. Each presses a Christian claim on
whatever is wanted of our hospitality. But if all had
what they desire there would be no personal life left.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some whose highways are broad,
whose wells and streams are overflowing, whose lives
are not fully engaged, show themselves exclusive and
inhospitable&mdash;like those proprietors of vast moors who
refuse a path to the waterfall or the mountain-top.
Without Edom's excuse, some modern Idumæans warn
every enterprise off their bounds. Neither brotherhood
nor any other claim is acknowledged. They would
find advantage, not injury, in the visit of those who
bring new enthusiasms and ideas to bear on existence.
They would learn of other aims than occupy them, a
better hope than they possess. Their sympathy would
be enlisted in heavenly or humane endeavours, and
new alliances would quicken as well as broaden their
life. But they will not listen; they continue selfish
to the end. Against all such Christianity has to urge
the law of brotherhood and of sacrifice.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>We have assumed that Kadesh was on the western
side of the Arabah, and it is necessary to take ver. 20
as referring to an incident that occurred after the
Israelites had crossed the valley. Not otherwise can
we explain how they came to encamp among the
mountains on the eastern side. The repulse must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
been sustained by the tribes after they had left Kadesh
and penetrated some distance into the northern defiles
of Idumæa. Bozrah, the capital, appears to have been
situated about half way between Petra and the southern
extremity of the Dead Sea, and a force issuing from
that stronghold would divert the march southward so
that the Israelites could safely encamp only when they
reached the open plain near Mount Hor. Hither therefore
they retreated: and here it was that Moses and
Aaron were parted. The time had come for the high
priest to be gathered to his people.</p>

<p>Scarcely any locality in the whole track of the
wandering is better identified than this. From the
plain of the Arabah the mountains rise in a range
parallel to the valley, in ridges of sandstone, limestone,
and chalk, with cliffs and peaks of granite. The defile
that leads by Mount Hor to Petra is peculiarly grand,
for here the range attains its greatest height. "Through
a narrow ravine," says one traveller, "we ascended a
steep mountain side, amid a splendour of colour from
bare rock or clothing verdure, and a solemnity of light
on the broad summits, of shade in the profound depths&mdash;a
memory for ever.... It was the same narrow
path through which in old times had passed other
trains of camels laden with the merchandise of India,
Arabia, and Egypt. And thus having ascended, we
had next a long descent to the foot of Mount Hor,
which stands isolated." The mountain rises about four
thousand feet above the Arabah and has a peculiar
double crest. On its green pastures there graze flocks
of sheep and goats; and inhabited caves&mdash;used perhaps
since the days of the old Horites&mdash;are to be seen here
and there. The ascent of the mountain is aided by
steps cut in the rock, "indeed a tolerably complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
winding staircase," for the chapel or mosque on the
summit, said to cover the grave of Aaron, is a notable
Arab sanctuary, resorted to by many pilgrims. "From
the roof of the tomb&mdash;now only an ordinary square
building with a dome&mdash;northward and southward, a
hilly desert; eastward, the mountains of Edom, within
which Petra lies hid; westward, the desert of the
Arabah, or wilderness of Zin; beyond that, the desert
of Et-Tîh; beyond that again, in the far horizon, the
blue-tinted hills of the Land of Promise."</p>

<p>Such is the mountain at the foot of which Israel lay
encamped when the Lord said unto Moses, "Take
Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto
Mount Hor; and strip Aaron of his garments, and put
them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered
unto his people and shall die there." We imagine the
sorrowful gaze of the multitude following the three
climbers, the aged brothers who had borne so long the
burden and heat of the day, and Eleazar, already well
advanced in life, who was to be invested with his father's
office. Coming soon after the death of Miriam, this
departure of Aaron broke sharply one other link that
still bound Israel with its past. The old times were
receding, the new had not yet come into sight.</p>

<p>The life of a good man may close mournfully. While
some in leaving the world cross cheerfully the river
beyond which the smiling fields of the heavenly land
are full in view, others there are who, even with the
faith of the Conqueror of death to sustain them, have
no gladdening prospect at the last. Only from a
distance Aaron saw the Land of Promise; from so great
a distance that its beauty and fruitfulness could not
be realised. The sullen gleam of the Lake of Sodom,
lying in its grim hollow, was visible away to the north.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Besides that the dim eyes could make out little. But
Edom lay below; and the tribes would have a great
circuit round that inhospitable land, would have to
traverse another desert beyond the horizon to the east,
ere they could reach Moab and draw near to Canaan.
A true patriot, Aaron would think more of the people
than of himself. And the confidence he had in the
friendliness of God and the wisdom of his brother would
scarcely dispel the shadow that settled on him as
he forecast the journey of the tribes and saw the
difficulties they were yet to meet. So not a few are
called away from the world when the great ends for
which they have toiled are still remote. The cause of
liberty or of reformation with which life has been
identified may even appear farther from success than
years before. Or again, the close of life may be
darkened by family troubles more pressing than any
that were experienced earlier. A man may be heavily
burdened without distrusting God on his own account,
or doubting that in the long run all shall be well. He
may be troubled because the immediate prospect shows
no escape from painful endurance for those he loves.
He does not sorrow perhaps that he has found the
promises of life to be illusory; but he is grieved for
dear friends who must yet make that discovery, who
shall travel many a league and never win the battle or
pass beyond the wilderness.</p>

<p>The mind of Aaron as he went to his death was
darkened by the consciousness of a great failure.
Kadesh lay westward across the valley, and the thought
of what took place there was with the brothers as they
climbed Mount Hor and stood upon its summit. They
had repented, but they had not yet forgiven themselves.
How could they, when they saw in the temper of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
people too plain proofs that their lese-majesty had
borne evil fruit? It needs much faith to be sure that
God will remedy the evil we have done; and so long as
the means cannot be seen, the shadow of self-reproach
must remain. Many a good man, climbing the last
slope, feels the burden of transgressions committed
long before. He has done his utmost to restore the
defences of truth and rebuild the altars of witness
which in thoughtless youth or proud manhood he cast
down. But circumstances have hindered the work of
reparation; and many who saw his sin have passed far
beyond the reach of his repentance. The thought of
past faults may sadly obscure the close of a Christian
life. The end would indeed be hopeless often were it
not for trust in the omnipotent grace which brings
again that which was driven away and binds up that
which was broken. Yet since the very work of God and
the victory of Christ are made more difficult by things
a believer has done, is it possible that he should always
have happy recollections of the past as life draws near
its end?</p>

<p>It was no doubt honourable to Aaron that his death
was appointed to be on that mountain in Seir. Old as
he was, he would never think of complaining that he was
ordained to climb it. Yet to the tired limbs it was
a steep, difficult path, a way of sorrow. Here, also,
we find resemblance to the close of many a worthy life.
High office in the Church has been well served, overflowing
wealth has been used in beneficence; but at
the last reverses have come. The man who was always
prosperous is now stripped of his possessions. Darkened
in mind by successive losses, bereaved of friends and
of power, he has to climb a dreary mountain-path to
the sharp end. It may be really honourable to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
a man that God has thus appointed his death to be not
in the midst of luxury, but on the rugged peak of loss.
Understanding things aright, he should say: "The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
name of the Lord." But if dependence is felt as shame,
if he who gave freely to others feels it a sore thing to
receive from others, who can have the heart to blame
the good man because he does not triumph here? And
if he has to climb alone, no Eleazar with him, scarcely
one human aid, what shall we say? Now life must
gird itself and go whither it would not. Sad is the
journey, but not into night. The Christian does not
impeach Divine providence nor grieve that earthly good
is finally taken away. Though his life has been in his
generosity, not in his possessions, yet he will confess
that the last bitter trial is needful to the perfecting of
faith.</p>

<p>Should the believer triumph over death through
Christ? It is his privilege; but some display unwarranted
complacency. They have confidence in the work
of Christ; they boast that they rest everything on Him.
But is it well with them if they have no sorrow because
of days and years that ran to waste? Is it well with
them if they deplore no failure in Christian effort when
the reason is that they never gave heart and strength
to any difficult task? Who can be satisfied with the
apparent victory of faith at the last of one who never
had high hopes for himself and others, and therefore
was never disappointed? Better the sorrowful ending
to a life that has dared great things and been defeated,
that has cherished a pure ideal and come painfully short
of it, than the exultation of those who even as Christians
have lived to themselves.</p>

<p>Perhaps the circumstances that attended the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of Aaron were to him the finest discipline of life.
Climbing the steep slope at the command of God, would
he not feel himself brought into a closer relation with
the Eternal Will? Would he not feel himself separated
from the world and gathered up into the quiet massiveness
of life with Him who is from everlasting to everlasting?
The years of a high priest, dealing constantly
with sacred things and symbols, might easily fall into
a routine not more helpful to generous thought and
spiritual exaltation than the habits of secular life. One
might exist among sacrifices and purifications till the
mind became aware of nothing beyond ritual and
its orderly performance. True, this had not been
the case with Aaron during a considerable portion of
the time since he began his duties. There had been
many events by means of which Jehovah broke in upon
the priests with His great demands. But thirty-seven
years had been comparatively uneventful. And now
the little world of camp and tabernacle court, the sacred
shrine with its ark, the symbolic dwelling-place of God,
must have their contrast in the broad spaces filled with
gleaming light, the blue vault, the widespread hills and
valleys, the heavens which are Jehovah's throne, the
earth which is His footstool. The bustle of Israel's
little life is left behind for the calm of the mountain
land. The high priest finds another vestibule of the
dwelling of Jehovah than that which he has been accustomed
to enter with sprinkled blood and the pungent
fumes of the incense.</p>

<p>Is it not good thus to be called away from the business
of the world, immersed in which every day men
have lost the due proportions of things, both of what
is earthly and what is spiritual? They have to leave
the computations recorded in their books, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
bulks largely in the gossip of the way and the news of
the town; they are to climb where greater spaces can
be seen, and human life, both as brief and as immortal,
shall be understood in its relations to God. Often
those who have this call addressed to them are most
unwilling to obey. It is painful to lose the old standards
of proportion, to hear no longer the familiar noise of
wheels, to see no machinery, no desks, no ledgers, to
read no newspapers, to have the quiet, the slow-moving
days, the moonless or moonlit nights. But if reflection
follows, as it should, and brings wisdom, the change
has saved a man who was near to being lost. The things
he toiled for once, as well as the things he dreaded,&mdash;that
success, this breath of adverse opinion,&mdash;seem little
in the new light, scarcely disturb the new atmosphere.
One thus called apart with God, learning what are the
real elements of life, may look with pity on his former
self, yet gather out of the experience that had small
value, for the most part, here and there a jewel of price.
And the wise, becoming wiser, will feel preparation
made for the greater existence that lies beyond.</p>

<p>Moses accompanied his brother to the mountain top.
By his hands, with all considerateness, the priestly
robes were taken from Aaron's shoulders and put on
Eleazar. The true friend he had all along relied upon
was with the dying man at the last, and closed his eyes.
In this there was a palliation of the decree under which
it would have been terrible to suffer alone; yet in the
end the loneliness of death had to be felt. We know
a Friend who passed through death for us, and made a
way into the higher life, but still we have our dread of
the solitude. How much heavier must it have weighed
when no clear hope of immortality shone upon the hill.
The vastness of nature was around the dying priest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Israel, his face was turned to the skies. But the thrill
of Divine love we find in the touch of Christ did not
reassure him. "These all ... received not the promise,
God having provided some better thing concerning us,
that apart from us they should not be made perfect."</p>

<p>Eleazar followed Aaron and took up the work of
the priesthood, not less ably, let us believe, yet not
precisely with the same spirit, the same endowments.
And indeed to have one in all respects like Aaron
would not have served. The new generation, in new
circumstances, needs a new minister. Office remains;
but, as history moves on, it means always something
different. When the hour comes that requires a clear
step to be taken away from old notions and traditions
of duty, neither he who holds the office nor those to
whom he has ministered should complain or doubt.
It is not good that one should cling to work merely
because he has served well and may still seem able
to serve; often it is the case that before death commands
a change the time for one has come. Even the
men who are most useful to the world, Paul, Apollos,
Luther, do not die too soon. It may appear to us
that a man who has done noble work has no successor.
When, for instance, England loses its Dr. Arnold,
Stanley, Lightfoot, and we look in vain for one to
whom the robes are becoming, we have to trust that
by some education they did not foresee the Church has
to be perfected. The same theory, nominally, is not
the same when others undertake to apply it. The
same ceremonies have another meaning when performed
by other hands. There are ways to the full fruition
of Christ's government which go as far about as
Israel's to Canaan round the land of Moab, for a
time as truly retrogressive. But the great Leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
the one High Priest of the new covenant, never fails
His Church or His world, and the way that does
not hasten, as well as that which makes straight for
the goal, is within His purpose, leads to the fulfilment
among men of His mediatorial design.</p>

<h2>XVII<br /><br />

<i>THE LAST MARCH AND THE FIRST CAMPAIGN</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxi</h4>

<p>It has been suggested in a previous chapter that
the repulse of the Israelites by the King of Arad
took place on the occasion when, after the return of
the spies, a portion of the army endeavoured to force
its way into Canaan. If that explanation of the passage
with which chap. xxi. opens cannot be accepted, then
the movements of the tribes after they were driven
back from Edom must have been singularly vacillating.
Instead of turning southward along the Arabah they
appear to have moved northward from Mount Hor and
made an attempt to enter Canaan at the southern end
of the Dead Sea. Arad was in the Negeb or South
Country, and the Canaanites there, keeping guard,
must have descended from the hills and inflicted a
defeat which finally closed that way.</p>

<p>From the time of the departure from Kadesh onward
no mention is made of the pillar of cloud. It may
have still moved as the standard of the host; yet the
unsuccessful attempt to pass through Edom, followed
possibly by a northward march, and then by a southward
journey to the Elanitic Gulf when they "compassed
Mount Seir many days" (Deut. ii. 1), would
appear to prove that the authoritative guidance had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
some way failed. It is a suggestion, which, however,
can only be advanced with diffidence, that after the day
at Kadesh when the words fell from Moses' lips, "Hear
now, ye rebels," his power as a leader declined, and that
the guidance of the march fell mainly into the hands of
Joshua,&mdash;a brave soldier indeed, but no acknowledged
representative of Jehovah. It is at all events clear
that attempts had now to be made in one direction
and another to find a feasible route. Moses may have
retired from the command, partly on account of age,
but even more because he felt that he had in part
lost his authority. Israel, moreover, had to become a
military nation: and Moses, though nominally the
head of the tribes, had to stand aside to a great extent
that the new development might proceed. In a short
time Joshua would be sole leader; already he appears
to hold the military command.</p>

<p>The journey from Mount Hor to the borders of Moab
by way of the Red Sea, or Yâm-Suph, is very briefly
noticed in the narrative. Oboth, Iye-abarim, Zared,
are the only three names mentioned in chap. xxi. before
the border of Moab is reached. Chap. xxxiii.
gives Zalmonah, Punon, Oboth, and lastly Iye-abarim,
which is said to be in the border of Moab. The mention
of these names suggests nothing as to the extremely
trying nature of the journey; that is only indicated by
the statement, "the soul of the people was much discouraged
because of the way." The truth is, that of all
the stages of the wandering, these along the Arabah, and
from the Elanitic Gulf eastward and northward to the
valley of Zared, were perhaps the most difficult and
perilous. The Wady Arabah is "an expanse of shifting
sands, broken by innumerable undulations, and counter-sected
by a hundred watercourses." Along this plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the route lay for fifty miles, in the track of the furious
sirocco and amidst terrible desolation. Turning eastward
from the palm-groves of Elath and the beautiful
shores of the Gulf, the way next entered a tract of the
Arabian wilderness outside the border of Edom. Oboth
lay, perhaps, east from Maan, still an inhabited city,
and the point of departure for one who journeys from
Palestine into central Arabia. Out from Maan this
desert lies, and is thus described:&mdash;"Before and around
us extended a wide and level plain, blackened over
with countless pebbles of basalt and flint, except when
the moonbeams gleamed white on little intervening
patches of clear sand, or on yellowish streaks of withered
grass, the scanty produce of the winter rains, and now
dried into hay. Over all a deep silence which even our
Arab companions seemed fearful of breaking; when they
spoke it was in a half whisper and in few words, while
the noiseless tread of our camels sped stealthily but
rapidly through the gloom without disturbing its stillness."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
For one hundred miles the route for Israel
lay through this wilderness; and it is hardly possible
to escape the conviction that although little is said of
the experiences of the way the tribes must have suffered
enormously and been greatly reduced in number. As
for cattle, we must conclude that hardly any survived.
Where camels sustain themselves with the greatest
difficulty, oxen and sheep would certainly perish. There
had come the necessity for a rapid advance, to be made
at whatever hazard. All that would retard the progress
of the people had to be sacrificed. There is indeed
some ground for the supposition that part of the tribes
remained near Kadesh while the main body made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
long and perilous detour. The army entering Canaan
by way of Jericho would as soon as possible open communication
with those who had been left behind.</p>

<p>The only recorded episode belonging to the period
of this march is that of the fiery serpents. In the
Arabah and the whole North Arabian region the cobra,
or <i>naja haie</i>, is common, and is superstitiously dreaded.
Other serpents are so innocuous by comparison that
this chiefly receives the attention of travellers. One
incident is recorded thus by Mr. Stuart-Glennie:&mdash;"Two
cobras have been caught, and one, which has
been dexterously pinned by the neck in the slit end
of a stick, its captor comes up triumphantly to exhibit....
After a time the fellow let it go, refusing to kill
it, and permitting it to glide away unharmed. This
I understood to be from fear&mdash;fear of the vengeance
after death of what, in life, had been incapable of
defending itself. At Petra ... the snakes which
Hamilton, a fearless hunter of them, killed, the Arabs
would not allow to lie within the encampment, asserting
that we should thus bring the whole snake-tribe to
which the individual belonged to avenge the death of
their kinsman." Whether all the serpents that attacked
the Israelites were cobras is doubtful; but the description
"fiery" seems to point to the effects of the cobra-poison,
which produces an intense burning sensation
in the whole body. Another explanation of the
adjective is found in the metallic sparkle of the reptiles.</p>

<p>"Much people of Israel died" of the bites of these
serpents, which, disturbed by the travellers as they
went sullenly and carelessly along, issued from crevices
of the ground and from the low shrubs in which they
lurked, and at once fastened on feet and hands. The
peculiar character of the new enemy caused universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
alarm. As one and another fell writhing to the
ground, and after a few convulsive movements died
in agony, a feeling of terrified revulsion spread through
the ranks. Pestilence was natural, familiar, as compared
with this new punishment which their murmuring
about the light food and the thirst of the desert had
brought on them. The serpent, lithe and subtle,
scarcely seen in the twilight, creeping into the tents
at night, quick at any moment, without provocation, to
use its poisoned fangs, has appeared the hereditary
enemy of man. As the instrument of the Tempter
it was connected with the origin of human misery;
it appeared the embodied evil which from the very
dust sprang forth to seek the evil-doer. Many ways
had Jehovah of reaching men who showed distrust
and resented His will. This was in a sense the most
dreadful.</p>

<p>The serpents that lurked in the Israelites' way and
darted suddenly upon them are always felt to be
analogues of the subtle sins that spring on man and
poison his life. What traveller knows the moment
when he may feel in his soul the sharp sting of evil
desire that will burn in him to a deadly fever? Men
who have been wounded can, for a time, hide from
fellow-travellers their mortal hurt. They keep on the
march and make shift to look like others. Then the
madness reveals itself. Words are spoken, deeds are
done, that show the vile inoculation taking effect. By-and-by
there is another moral death. Humanity may
well fear the power of evil thoughts, of lusts, of
envious feelings, that serpent-like attack and madden
the soul; may well look up and cry aloud to God for
a sufficient remedy. No herb nor balm to be found
in the gardens or fields of earth is an antidote to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
poison; nor can the surgeon excise the tainted flesh,
or destroy the virus by any brand of penance.</p>

<p>Resuming his generous part as intercessor for the
people, Moses sought and found the means to help
them. He was to make a serpent of brass, an image
of the foe, and erect it on a standard full in sight of the
camp, and to it the eyes of the stricken people were
to be turned. If they realised the Divine purpose of
grace and trusted Jehovah while they looked, the power
of the poison would be destroyed. The serpent of brass
was nothing in itself, was, as long afterwards Hezekiah
declared it to be, <i>nehushtan</i>; but as a symbol of the
help and salvation of God it served the end. The
stricken revived: the camp, almost in a panic through
superstitious fear, was calmed. Once more it was
known that He who smote the sinful, in wrath remembered
mercy. It must be assumed that there was
repentance and faith on the part of those who looked.
The serpents appear as the means of punishment, and
the poison loses its effect with the growth of the new
spirit of submission. It has rightly been pointed out
that the heathen view of the serpent as a healing power
has no countenance here. That singular belief must
have had its origin in the worship of the serpent which
arose from dread of it as an embodiment of demoniacal
energy. Our passage treats it as a creature of God,
ready, like the lightning and the pestilence, or like the
frogs and insects of the Egyptian plagues, to be used
as an instrument in bringing home to men their sins.</p>

<p>And when our Lord recalled the episode of the
healing of Israel by means of the brazen serpent, He
certainly did not mean that the image in itself was in
any sense a type or even symbol of Him. It was lifted
up; He was to be lifted up: it was to be looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
with the gaze of repentance and faith; He is to be
regarded, as He hangs on the cross, with the contrite,
believing look: it signified the gracious interposition
of God, who was Himself the True Healer; Christ is
lifted up and gives Himself on the cross in accordance
with the Father's will, to reveal and convey His love&mdash;these
are the points of similarity. "As Moses lifted up
the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son
of Man be lifted up." The uplifting, the healing, are
symbolic. The serpent-image fades out of sight. Christ
is seen giving Himself in generous love, showing us
the way of life when He dies, the just for the unjust.
He is the power of God unto salvation. With Him
we die that He may live in us. He judges us, condemns
us as sinners, and at the same time turns our
judgment into acquittal, our condemnation into liberty.
Israel's past and the grace of Jehovah to the stricken
tribes are connected by our Lord's words with the
redemption provided through His own sacrifice. The
Divine Healer of humanity is there and here; but here
in spiritual life, in quickening grace, not in an empirical
symbol. Christ on the cross is no mere sign of a
higher energy; the very energy is with Him, most
potent when He dies.</p>

<p>Like the serpent poison, that of sin creates a burning
fever, a mortal disease. But into all the springs and
channels of infected life the renovating grace of God
enters through the long deep look of faith. We see
the Man, our brother, full of sympathy, the Son of God
our sin-bearer. The pity is profound as our need; the
strong spiritual might, sin-conquering, life-giving, is
enough for each, more than sufficient for all. We look&mdash;to
wonder, to hope, to trust, to love, to rejoice with
joy unspeakable and full of glory. We see our condemnation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the handwriting of ordinances that is against
us&mdash;and we see it cancelled through the sacrifice of
our Divine Redeemer. Is it the death that moves us
first? Then we perceive love stronger than death,
love that can never die. Our souls go forth to find
that love, they are bound by it for ever to the Infinite
Truth, the Eternal Purity, the Immortal Life. We
find ourselves at length whole and strong, fit for the
enterprises of God. The trumpet call is heard; we
respond with joy. We will fight the good fight of
faith, suffering and achieving all through Christ.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>At Iye-abarim, the Heaps of the Outlands, "which
is toward the sunrising," the worst of the desert march
was over. That the long and dreary wilderness did
not swallow up the host is, humanly speaking, matter
of astonishment. Yet singular light is thrown on the
journey by an incident recorded by Mr. Palmer. In
the midst of the broken country extending from the
neighbourhood of the ancient Kadesh to the Arabah,
he and his companions encamped at the head of the
Wady Abu Taraimeh, which slopes to the south-east.
Here in the midst of the desolate mountains a quite
young girl, small, solitary traveller, was found. She
was on her way to Abdeh, some twenty miles behind,
and had come from a place called Hesmeh, six days'
journey beyond Akabah, a distance of some hundred
and fifty miles. "She had been without bread or
water, and had only eaten a few herbs to support
herself by the way." The simple trust of the child
could achieve what strong men might have pronounced
impossible. And the Israelites, knowing little of the
road, trusted and hoped and pressed on till the green
hills of Moab were at last in sight. The march was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
eastward of the present highway, which keeps within
the border of Edom and passes through El Buseireh,
the ancient Bozrah. We may suppose that the
Israelites followed a track afterwards chosen for a
Roman road and still traceable. The valley of Zared,
perhaps the modern Feranjy, would be reached about
fifteen miles east from the southern gulf of the Dead
Sea. Thence, striking on a watercourse and keeping
to the desert side of Ar, the modern Rabba, the
Hebrews would have a march of about twenty miles
to the Arnon, which at that time formed the boundary
between Moab and the Amorites.</p>

<p>At this point the history incorporates, why we cannot
tell, part of an old song from the "Book of the Wars
of Jehovah."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Vaheb in Suphah,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the valleys of Arnon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the slope of the valleys<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That inclineth toward the dwelling of Ar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And leaneth upon the border of Moab."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The picturesque topography of this chant, the meaning
of which as a whole is obscured for us by the first
line, may be the sole reason of its quotation. If we
read "Vaheb in storm" we have a word-picture of the
scene under impressive conditions; and if the storm
is that of war the relique may belong to the time
of the contest described in ver. 26 when the Amorite
chief, crossing Jordan, gained the northern heights and
drove the Moabites in confusion across the Arnon
toward the stronghold of Ar, some twelve or fifteen
miles to the south. Yet another ancient song is
connected with a station called Beer, or the Well,
some spot in the wilderness north of the Arnon valley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Moses points out the place where water may be found,
and as the digging goes on the chant is heard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The well which the princes digged,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which the nobles of the people delved,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the sceptre, and with their staves."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The seeking of the precious water by rude art in a
thirsty valley kindles the mind of some poet of the
people. And his song is spirited, with ample recognition
of the zeal of the princes who themselves take part in
the labour. While they dig he chants, and the people
join in the song till the words are fixed in their
memory, so as to become part of the traditions of Israel.</p>

<p>The finding of a spring, the discovery that by their
own effort they can reach the living water laid up for
them beneath the sand, is an event to the Israelites,
worth preserving in a national ballad. What does
this imply? That the resources of nature and the
means of unlocking them were still only beginning to
be understood? We are almost compelled to think so,
whatever conclusions this may involve. And Israel,
slowly finding out the Divine provision lying beneath
the surface of things, is a type of those who very
gradually discover the possibilities that are concealed
beneath the seemingly ordinary and unpromising. By
the beaten tracks of life, in its arid valleys, there are,
for those who dig, wells of comfort, springs of truth
and salvation. Men are athirst for inspiration, for
power. They think of these as endowments for which
they must wait. In point of fact they have but to open
the fountains of conscience and of generous feeling
in order to find what they desire. Multitudes faint by
the way because they will not seek for themselves the
water of Divine truth that would reinvigorate their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
being. When we trust to wells opened by others we
cannot obtain the supply suited to our special need.
Each for himself must discover Divine providence, duty,
conviction, the springs of repentance and of love. The
many wait, and never get beyond spiritual dependence.
The few, some with sceptre, some with staff, dig for
themselves and for the rest wells of new ardour and
sustaining thought. The whole of human life, we may
say, has beneath its surface veins and rills of heavenly
water. In heart and conscience we can find the will
of our Maker, the springs of His promises, revelations
of His power and love. More than we know of the
living water that flows through the world of humanity
like a river has its source in springs that have been
dug in waste places by those who reflected, who saw
in man's world and man's soul the work of the "faithful
Creator."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>From Beer in the wilderness the march skirted the
green fields and valleys of the country once held by
the Moabites, now under Sihon the Amorite. When
they had gone but a few stages along this route the
leaders of the host found it necessary to enter into
negotiations. They were now some twenty miles only
by road from the fords of Jordan, but Heshbon, a strong
fortress, confronted them. The Amorites must be either
conciliated or attacked. This time there was no circuitous
way that could be taken; a critical hour had
come.</p>

<p>The presence of the Amorites on the eastern side of
Jordan is accounted for in a passage extending from
vv. 26-30. Moab had apparently, as at a later time
referred to by one of the prophets, been at ease, resting
securely behind her mountain rampart. Suddenly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Amorite warriors, crossing the ford of Jordan and
pressing up the defile, had attacked and taken Heshbon;
and with the loss of that fortress Moab was practically
defenceless. Field by field the old inhabitants had
been driven back, out into the desert, southward beyond
the Arnon. Even as far as Ar itself the victors had
carried fire and sword. Retiring, they left all south
of the Arnon to the Moabites, and themselves occupied
the country from Arnon to Jabbok, a stretch of sixty
miles. The song of vv. 27-30 commemorates this
ancient war:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come ye to Heshbon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let the city of Sihon be built and established;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a fire is gone out of Heshbon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A flame from the city of Sihon:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It hath devoured Ar of Moab,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Lords of the High Places of Arnon.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Woe to thee, Moab!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The chant rejoicing over the defeated goes on to tell
how the sons of Moab fled, and her daughters were
taken captive; how the arms of the Amorite were
victorious from Heshbon to Dibon, over Nophah and
Medeba. The Israelites arriving soon after this sanguinary
conflict, found the conquered region immediately
beyond the Arnon open to their advance. The Amorites
had not yet occupied the whole of the land; their power
was concentrated about Heshbon, which according to
the song had been rebuilt.</p>

<p>The request made of Sihon to allow the passage of
a people on its way to Jordan and the country beyond
came possibly at a time when the Amorites were scarcely
prepared for resistance. They had been successful,
but their forces were insufficient for the large district<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
they had taken, larger considerably than that on the
other side of Jordan from which they had migrated.
In the circumstances Sihon would not grant the request.
These Israelites were bent on establishing themselves as
rivals: the answer accordingly was a refusal, and war
began. Refreshed by the spoil of the fields of Arnon,
and now almost within sight of Canaan, the Hebrew
fighting men were full of ardour. The conflict was
sharp and decisive. Apparently in a single battle the
power of Sihon was broken. Leaving his fortress the
Amorite chief had gone out against Israel "into the
wilderness"; and at Jahaz the fight went against
him. From Arnon to Jabbok his land lay open to the
conquerors.</p>

<p>And having once tasted success the warriors of
Israel did not sheathe their swords. The fortress of
Amman guarded the land of the Ammonites so strongly
that it seemed for the time perilous to strike in that
direction. Crossing the valley of the Jabbok, however,
and leaving the fierce Ammonites unattacked, the
Israelites had Bashan before them; a fertile region
of innumerable streams, populous, and with many
strongholds and cities. There was hesitation for a
time, but the oracle of Jehovah reassured the army.
Og the king of Bashan waited the attack at Edrei in
the north of his kingdom, about forty miles east from
the Sea of Galilee. Israel was again victorious. The
king of Bashan, his sons, and his army were cut to
pieces.</p>

<p>Such was the rapid success the Israelites had in
their first campaign, amazing enough, though partly
explained by the strifes and wars which had reduced
the strength of the peoples they attacked. We must
not suppose, however, that though the Amorites and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the people of Bashan were defeated, their lands were
occupied or could be occupied at once. What had been
done was rather in the way of defending the passage
of the Jordan than providing a settlement for any
of the tribes. When the Reubenites, Gadites, and
Manassites came to dwell in those districts east of the
Jordan, they had to make good their ground against
the old inhabitants who remained.</p>

<p>The army had passed into the north, but the main
body of the people descended from the neighbourhood
of Heshbon by a pass leading to the Jordan Valley.
The return of the victorious troops after a few months
gave them the assurance that at last they could safely
prepare for the long expected entrance into the Land
of Promise.</p>

<p>Suffering and the discipline of the wilderness had
educated the Israelites for the day of action. By what
a long and tedious journey they reached their success!
Behind them, yet with them still, was Sinai, whose
lightnings and awful voices made them aware of the
power of Jehovah into covenant with whom they entered,
whose law they received. As a people bound
solemnly to the unseen Almighty God they left that
mountain and journeyed towards Kadesh. But the
covenant had neither been thoroughly accepted nor
thoroughly understood. They began their march from
the mountain of the Lord as the people of Jehovah, yet
expecting that He was to do all for them, require little
at their hands. The other side of privilege, the duty
they owed to God, had to be impressed by many a
painful chastisement, by the sorrows and disasters of
the way. Wonderfully, all things considered, had they
sped, though their murmurings were the sign of an
ignorant rebellious temper which was incompatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
with any moral progress. By the long delay in the
wilderness of Kadesh that disposition had to be cured.
In a region not fertile like Canaan itself, yet capable
of supporting the tribes, they had to forget Egypt,
realise that forward not backward was their only way,
that while desert after desert intervened now between
them and Goshen, they were within a day's march of
the Promised Land. But even this was not enough.
Perhaps they might have crept gradually northward;
shifting their headquarters a few miles at a time till
they had taken possession of the Negeb and made a
settlement of some kind in Canaan. But if they had
done so, as a nation of shepherds, advancing timorously,
not boldly, they would have had no strength at the
opening of their career. And it was decreed that by
another door, in another spirit, they should enter.
Edom refused them access to the east country. They
had again to gird up their loins for a long journey.
And that last terrible march was the discipline they
required. Resolutely kept to it by their leader, on
through the Arabah, across the desert, to the "Heaps
of the Outlands towards the sunrising" they went,
with new need for courage, a new call to endure
hardness every day. Did they faint once, and turn
murmurers again? The serpents stung them in
judgment, and the cure was provided in grace. They
learned once more that it was One they could not
elude with whom they had to do, One who could be
severe and also kind, who could strike and also save.
Decimated, but knit together as they had never been,
the tribes reached the Arnon. And then, the first
trial of their arms made, they knew themselves a
conquering people, a people with power, a people with
a destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>It is so in the making of manhood, in the discipline
of the soul. Sinai, and the awful declarations of duty
and of the Divine claim there, must enter into our life;
it would be light, frivolous, and incapable otherwise.
But the revelation of power and righteousness does not
insure our submission to the power, our conformity to
the righteousness. Divine words have to be followed
by Divine deeds; we have to learn that in God's
kingdom there is to be no murmuring, no shrinking
even from death, no turning back. It is a lesson that
tries the generations. How many will not learn it!
In society, in the Church, the rebellious spirit is shown
and has to be corrected. At the "Graves of Lust,"
at the "Place of Burning," murmurers are judged,
those who refuse God's way fall and are left behind.
And when the Land of Promise is in sight possession
of it shall not be easily obtained by those who are still
half-wedded to the old life, distrustful of the righteousness
of God and His demand on the whole love and
service of the soul. There is indeed no heaven for
those who look back, who even if angels were to hurry
them on would still lament the losses of this life as
irremediable. There must be the courage of the daring
soul that adventures all on faith, on the Divine promise,
on the eternity of the spiritual.</p>

<p>Wherefore, that the earthly temper may be taken
out of us, we have to cross desert after desert, to make
long circuits through the hot and thirsty wilderness
even when we think our faith complete and our hope
nigh its fulfilment. It is as those who overcome we
are to enter the kingdom. Not as "the world's poor
routed leavings," not obtaining permission from Edomites
or Amorites to slip ingloriously through their land,
but as those who with the sword of the Spirit can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
hew our own way through falsehoods and bring down
the lusts of the flesh and of the mind, as warriors of
God we are to reach and cross the border. How
many survive, having gone through discipline like
this? How many overcome and have the right to
pass through the gate into the city?</p>

<h2>XVIII<br /><br />

<i>BALAAM INVOKED</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxii. 1-19</h4>

<p>While a part of the army of Israel was engaged
in the campaign against Bashan, the tribes
remained "in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan
at Jericho." The topography is given here, as elsewhere,
from the point of view of one dwelling in Canaan;
and the locality indicated is a level stretch of land,
some five or six miles broad, between the river and the
hills. In this plain there was ample room for the
encampment, while along the Jordan and on the slopes
to the east all the produce of field and garden, the spoil
of conquest, was at the disposal of the Israelites. They
rested therefore, after their long journey, in sight of
Canaan, waiting first for the return of the troops, then
for the command to advance; and the delay may very
likely have extended to several months.</p>

<p>Now the march of Israel had kept to the desert side
of Moab, so that the king and people of that land had
no reason to complain. But the campaign against the
Amorites, ending so quickly and decisively for the
invaders, showed what might have taken place if they
had attacked Moab, what might yet come to pass if
they turned southward instead of crossing the Jordan.
And there was great dismay. "Moab was sore afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
of the people, because they were many: and Moab was
distressed because of the children of Israel." Manifestly
it would have been unwise for Balak the king of the
Moabites to attack Israel single-handed. But others
might be enlisted against this new and vigorous enemy,
among them the Midianites. And to these Balak turned
to consult in the emergency.</p>

<p>By the "Midianites" we must understand the
Bedawin of the time, the desert tribes which possibly
had their origin in Midian, east of the Elanitic Gulf,
but were now spread far and wide. On the borders
of Moab a large and important clan of this people fed
their flocks; and to their elders Balak appealed.
"Now," he said, "shall this multitude lick up all that
is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the
field." The result of the consultation was not an
expedition of war but one of a quite different kind.
Even the wild Bedawin had been dismayed by the firm
resolute tread of the Israelites, a people marching on,
as no people had ever been seen to march, from faraway
Egypt to find a new home. The elders of Moab
and of Midian cannot decide on war; but superstition
points to another means of attack. May they not
obtain a curse against Israel, under the influence of
which its strength shall decay? Is there not in Pethor
one who knows the God of this people and has the
power of dreadful malediction? They will send for
him; Balaam shall invoke disaster on the invaders,
then peradventure Balak will prevail, and smite them,
and drive them out of the land.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt in what direction we are
to look for Pethor, the dwelling-place of the great
diviner. It is "by the River," that is to say, by the
River Euphrates. It is in Aram, for thence Balaam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
says Balak has brought him. It is in "the land of the
children of Ammo" (xxii. 5), for such is the preferable
translation of the words rendered "children of his
people." The situation of Pethor has been made out.
"At an early period in Assyrian research," says Mr.
A. H. Sayce,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "Pethor was identified by Dr. Hincks
with the Pitru of the cuneiform inscriptions. Pitru
stood on the western bank of the Euphrates, close to
its junction with the Sajur, and a little to the north
of the latter. It was consequently only a few miles to
the south of the Hittite capital Carchemish. Indeed,
Shalmaneser II. tells us explicitly that the city was
called Pethor by 'the Hittites.' It lay on the main
road from east to west, and so occupied a position of
military and commercial importance." Originally an
Aramæan town, Pethor had received, on its conquest
by the Hittites, a new element of population from that
race, and the two peoples lived in it side by side. The
Aramæans of Pethor called themselves "the sons of
(the god) Ammo"; and, according to Mr. Sayce, Dr.
Neubauer is right in explaining the name of Balaam
as a compound of Baal with Ammi, which occurs as
a prefix in the Hebrew names Ammiel, Amminadab,
and others. It is also worthy of mention that the
name of Balak's father&mdash;Zippor, or "Bird"&mdash;occurs
in the notice, still extant, of a despatch sent by the
Egyptian government to Palestine in the third year of
Menephtah II.</p>

<p>It may be further said with regard to Mr. Sayce's
valuable work, that he does not attempt to deal particularly
with the prophecies of Balaam. "They must,"
he says, "be explained by Hebrew philology before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the records of the monuments can be called upon to
illustrate them. It may be that the text is corrupt; it
may be that passages have been added at various times
to the original prophecy of the Aramæan seer; these
are questions which must be settled before the Assyriologist
can determine when it was that the Kenite was
carried away captive, or when Asshur himself was
'afflicted.'"</p>

<p>The divination of which so great things were expected
by Balak is amply illustrated in the Babylonian
remains. Among the Chaldeans the art of divination
rested "on the old belief in every object of inanimate
nature being possessed or inhabited by a spirit, and
the later belief in a higher power, ruling the world and
human affairs to the smallest detail, and constantly
manifesting itself through all things in nature as through
secondary agents, so that nothing whatever could occur
without some deeper significance which might be discovered
and expounded by specially trained and favoured
individuals." The Chaldeo-Babylonians "not only
carefully noted and explained dreams, drew lots in
doubtful cases by means of inscribed arrows, interpreted
the rustle of trees, the plashing of fountains and murmur
of streams, the direction and form of lightnings, not
only fancied that they could see things in bowls of
water, and in the shifting forms assumed by the flame
which consumed sacrifices and the smoke which rose
therefrom, and that they could raise and question the
spirits of the dead, but drew presages and omens, for
good or evil, from the flight of birds, the appearance
of the liver, lungs, heart, and bowels of the animals
offered in sacrifice and opened for inspection, from the
natural defects or monstrosities of babies or the young
of animals&mdash;in short, from any and everything that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
they could possibly subject to observation." There
were three classes of wise men, astrologers, sorcerers,
and soothsayers; all were in constant demand, and all
used rules and principles settled for them by the so-called
science which was their study.</p>

<p>We cannot of course affirm that Balaam was one of
these Chaldeans, or that his art was precisely of the
kind described. He is declared by the narrative to have
received communications from God. There can, however,
be no doubt that his wide reputation rested on the
mystical rites by which he sought his oracles, for these,
and not his natural sagacity, would impress the common
mind. When the elders of Moab and Midian went to
seek him they carried the "rewards of divination" in
their hands. It was believed that he might obtain
from Jehovah the God of the Israelites some knowledge
concerning them on which a powerful curse might be
based. If then, in right of his office, he pronounced
the malediction, the power of Israel would be taken
away. The journey to Pethor was by the oasis of
Tadmor and the fords at Carchemish. A considerable
time, perhaps a month, would be occupied in going and
returning. But there was no other man on whose
insight and power dependence could be placed. Those
who carried the message were men of rank, who might
have gone as ambassadors to a king. It was confidently
expected that the soothsayer would at once undertake
the important commission.</p>

<p>Arriving at Pethor they find Balaam and convey the
message, which ends with the flattering words, "I
know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he
whom thou cursest is cursed." But they have to treat
with no vulgar thaumaturgist, no mere weaver of spells
and incantations. This is a man of intellectual power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
a diplomatist, whose words and proceedings have a
tone of high purpose and authority. He hears attentively,
but gives no immediate answer. From the first
he takes a position fitted to make the ambassadors feel
that if he intervenes it will be from higher motives than
desire to earn the rewards with which they presume
to tempt him. He is indeed a prince of his tribe, and
will be moved by nothing less than the oracle of that
unseen Being whom the chiefs of Moab and Midian
cannot approach. Let the messengers wait, that in the
shadow and silence of night Balaam may inquire of
Jehovah. His answer shall be in accordance with the
solemn, secret word that comes to him from above.</p>

<p>Three of the New Testament writers, the Apostles
Peter, John, and Jude, refer to Balaam in terms of
reprobation. He is "Balaam the son of Beor who
loved the hire of wrongdoing"; he "taught Balak to
cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel,
to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication";
he is the type of those who run riotously in
the way of error for hire. Gathering up the impressions
of his whole life, these passages declare him avaricious
and cunningly malignant, a prophet who perverting his
gifts brought on himself a special judgment. At the
outset, however, Balaam does not appear in this light.
The pictorial narrative shows a man of imposing
personality, who claims the "vision and the faculty
Divine." He seems resolute to keep by the truth
rather than gratify any dreams of ambition or win
great pecuniary rewards. It is worth while to study
a character so mingled, in circumstances that may be
called typical of the old world.</p>

<p>Did Balaam enjoy communications with God? Had
he real prophetic insight? Or must we hold with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
some that he only professed to consult Jehovah, and
found the answer to his inquiries in the conclusions of
his own mind?</p>

<p>It would appear at first sight that Balaam, as a
heathen, was separated by a great gulf from the
Hebrews. But at the time to which the narrative of
Numbers refers, if not at the period of its composition,
the boundary line implied by the word "gentile" did
not exist. Moses had clearly taught to the Hebrews
ethical and religious truths which neighbouring nations
saw very indistinctly; and the Israelites were beginning
to know themselves a chosen race. Yet Abraham was
their father, and other peoples could claim descent
from him. Edom, for example, is in Numbers xx.
acknowledged as Israel's brother.</p>

<p>At the stage of history, then, to which our passage
belongs, the strongly marked differences between nation
and nation afterwards insisted upon were not realised.
And this is so far true in respect of religion, that
though the Kenites, a Midianite tribe, did not follow
the way of Jehovah, Moses, as we have seen, had no
difficulty in joining with them in a sacrificial feast in
honour of the Lord of Heaven. If beyond the circle
of the tribes any one, impressed by their history,
attributing their rescue from Egypt and their successful
march towards Canaan to Jehovah, acknowledged His
greatness and began to approach Him with sacred
rites, no doubt would have existed among the Hebrews
generally that by such a man their God could be found
and His favour won. The narrative before us, stating
that Jehovah called Balaam and communicated with
him, simply declares what the more patriotic and
religious Israelites would have had no difficulty whatever
in receiving. This diviner of Pethor had heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Israel's deliverance at the Red Sea, had followed with
keen interest the progress of the tribes, had made
himself acquainted with the law of Jehovah given at
Sinai. Why, then, should he not worship Jehovah?
And why should not Jehovah speak to him, make
revelations to him of things still in the future?</p>

<p>So far, however, we touch only the beliefs, or possible
beliefs, of the Israelites. The facts may be quite
different. We are in the way of considering revelations
of the Divine will to have been so uncommon and sacred
that a man of very high character alone could have
enjoyed them. If indeed God spoke to Balaam, it must
have been in another way than to Abraham, Moses,
Elijah. Especially since his history shows him to have
been a man bad at heart, we are inclined to pronounce
his consultation of God mere pretence; and as for his
prophecies, did he not simply hear of Israel's greatness
and forecast the future with the prescience of a clear
calculator, who used his eyes and reason to good
purpose? But with this the gist of the Bible narrative
cannot be said to agree. It seems to be certainly
implied that God did speak to Balaam, open his eyes,
unfold to him things far off in the future. Although
many cases might be adduced which go to prove that
an acute man of the world, weighing causes and tracing
the drift of things, may show wonderful foresight, yet
the language here used points to more than that. It
seems to mean that Divine illumination was given to
one beyond the circle of the chosen people, to one who
from the first was no friend of God and at the last
showed himself a malicious enemy of Israel. And the
doctrine must be that any one who, looking beneath
the surface of things, studying the character of men and
peoples, connects the past and the present and anticipates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
events which are still far off, has his illumination from
God. Further it is taught that in a real sense the
man who has some conception of Providence, though
he is false at heart, may yet, in the sincerity of an
hour, in the serious thought roused at some crisis, have
a word of counsel, a clear indication of duty, a revelation
of things to come which others do not receive.
Still we must interpret the words, "God said to Balaam,"
in a way which will not lift him into the ranks of the
heaven-directed who are in any sense mediators,
prophets of the age and the world. This man has his
knowledge so far from above, has his insight as a true
gift, receives the word of prohibition, of warning,
veritably from a Divine source. Yet he does not stand
in a high position, lifted above other men. The whole
history is of value for our instruction, because as surely
as Balaam received directions from God, we also receive
them through conscience; because as he opposed God
so we also may oppose Him in self-will or the evil
mind. When we are urged to do what is right the
urgency is Divine, as certainly as if a voice from heaven
fell on our ears. Only when we realise this do we feel
aright the solemnity of obligation. If we fail to ascribe
our knowledge and our sense of duty to God, it will
seem a light thing to neglect the eternal laws by which
we should be ruled.</p>

<p>Reaching Pethor the messengers of Balak state their
request. Instead of going with them at once, as a
false man might be expected to do, Balaam declares
that he must consult Jehovah; and the result of his
consultation is that he declines. In the morning he
says to the princes of Moab, "Get you into your
land, for Jehovah refuseth to give me leave to go
with you." The question whether Israel was a fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
subject for blessing or for cursing has been practically
settled in his mind. When he lays the matter before
Jehovah, as he knows Him through His law and the
history of Israel, it is made unmistakable that no
malediction is to be pronounced. But what, then,
was the secret of Balaam's delay, of his consultation
of the oracle? If it had been an absolute determination
to serve the interests of righteousness, he
could now frame his reply to the princes in such a
way that they would understand it to be final. He
would not say demurely, "Jehovah refuseth to give
me leave," for these words allow the belief that
somehow the power to curse may yet be obtained.
Balaam permits himself to hope that he will find some
flaw in Israel's relation to Jehovah which will leave
room for a malediction. He delays, and professes to
consult God, diplomatically, that even by the refusal
his fame as a diviner acquainted with the Unseen
Power may be established. And the answer he returns
means that his own reputation is not to be hazarded
by any divination which Jehovah will discredit.</p>

<p>Had not the future proceedings of Balaam cast their
shadow back on his career and words, he might have
been pronounced at the outset a man of integrity.
The rewards offered him were probably large. We
may believe that whatever reputation Balaam had
previously enjoyed this embassy was the most important
ever sent to him, the greatest tribute to his fame.
And we would have been inclined to say, Here is an
example of conscientiousness. Balaam might go with
the princes at least, though he can pronounce no curse
on Israel; but he does not; he is too honourable even
to profess the desire to gratify his patrons. This
favourable judgment, however, is forbidden. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
of himself, of his fame and position, he was thinking.
He would not have gone in any case unless it had
precisely suited his purpose. Understanding that Israel
is not to be cursed, he manages so that his refusal
shall enhance his own reputation.</p>

<p>Still, the small amount of sincerity there is in Balaam,
superimposed on his self-love and diplomacy, is in
contrast to the utter want of it which men often show.
They are of a party, and at the first call they will
make shift to denounce whatever their leaders bid
them denounce. There is no pretence even of waiting
for a night to have time for quiet reflection; much
less any anxious thought regarding Divine providence,
righteousness, mercy, by means of which duty may
be discovered. It is possible for men to appear
earnest defenders of religion who never go even as
far as Balaam went in seeking the guidance of truth
and principle. They pass judgments with a haste
that shows the shallow heart. Tempted by some
envious Balak within, even when no appeal is made,
they set up as soothsayers and take on them to
prophesy evil.</p>

<p>The messengers of Balak returned with the report
of their disappointment; but what they had to say
caused, as Balaam no doubt intended, greater anxiety
than ever to secure his services. One who was so
lofty, and at the same time so much in the secrets of
the God Israel worshipped, was indeed a most valuable
ally, and his help must be obtained at any price. Did
he say that Jehovah refused to give him leave? Balak
will assure him of rewards which no God of Israel can
give, very great recompense, tangible, immediate. Other
messengers are sent, more, and more honourable than
the former, and they carry very flattering offers. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
he will curse Israel, Balak the son of Zippor will do
for him whatever he desires. Nothing is to hinder
him from coming; neither the prohibition of Jehovah
nor anything else.</p>

<p>The conduct of Balaam when he is appealed to the
second time confirms the judgment it has been found
necessary to pronounce on his character. He behaves
like a man who has been expecting, and yet, with what
conscience he has, dreading, the renewed invitation.
He appears indeed to be emphatic in declaring his
superiority to the offer of reward: "If Balak would
give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go
beyond the word of the Lord my God, to do less or
more." The air of incorruptible virtue is kept. The
Moabites and Midianites are to understand that they
have to do with a man whose whole soul is set on
truth. And the protestation would deceive us&mdash;only
Balaam does not dismiss the men. Giving him all
credit for an intention still to keep right with the
Almighty, or, shall we say? allowing that he was too
clever a man to imperil his reputation by intending a
curse which would not be followed by any ill effects,
we find immediately that he is unwilling to let the
opportunity pass. He asks the messengers to tarry
for the night, that he may again consult Jehovah in the
matter. He has already seen the truth as to Israel,
the promise of its splendid career. Yet he will repeat
the inquiry, ask once more regarding the prospect he
has distinctly seen. It is ambition that moves him,
and perhaps, along with that, avarice. May he not be
able to say something that will sound like a curse,
something on which Balak shall fasten in the belief
that it gives him power against Israel? It would,
at all events, be a gratification to travel in state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
across the desert, to appear amongst the princes of
Midian and Moab as the man after whom kings had
to run. And there was the possibility that without
absolutely forfeiting his reputation as a seer of things
to come he might obtain at least a portion of the
reward. He will at all events do the messengers the
honour of seeking another oracle for their sakes, though
he dishonours the name of God from whom he seeks it.</p>

<p>It was possible for Balaam during the interval of the
two embassies to recover himself. He was one who
could understand integrity, who knew enough of the
conditions of success to see that absolute consistency
is the only strength. There was a straight way which
he might have followed. But temptation pressed on
him. Tired of the narrow field within which he had
as yet exercised his powers, he saw one wider and
more splendid open to him. The wealth was no small
inducement. He was in the way of divining for reward;
this was the greatest ever in his reach. And Balaam,
knowing well how base and vain his pretext was,
resigned his integrity, even the pretence of it, when he
bade the messengers wait.</p>

<p>Yet was his fault a singular one? We cannot say
that he showed extraordinary covetousness in desiring
Balak's silver and gold. For the time, in the circumstances,
scarcely anything else could be expected of a
man like him. To judge Balaam by modern Christian
rules is an anachronism. The remarkable thing is to
find one of his class at all scrupulous about the means
he employs to promote himself. We say that he was
guilty of perverting conscience; and so he was. But
his conscience did not see or speak so clearly as ours.
And are not Christian men liable to have their heads
turned by the countenance of those in a higher rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
than their own, and to succumb to the enticement of
great wealth? When they are asked to reconsider a
decision they know to be right, do they never tamper
with conscience? It is one of the commonest things
to find persons nominally religious indulging in the
same desires and acting in the same way as Balaam.
But the earthly craving that makes any one go back
to God a second time about a matter which ought to
have been settled once for all, involves the greatest
moral hazard. No human being, in any situation, has
spiritual strength to spare. There is a point where he
who hesitates casts the whole of his life into the balance.
For young persons, especially, a great warning, often
needed, lies here.</p>

<p>The fault of Balaam, a fault of which he could not
fail to be conscious, was that of tampering with his
inspiration. The insight he possessed&mdash;and which he
valued&mdash;had come through his sincere estimate of
things and men apart from any pressure brought to bear
on him to take a side either for money or for fame. His
mind using perfect freedom, travelling in a way of sincere
judgment, had reached a height from which he enjoyed
wide prospects. As a man and a prophet he had his
standing through this superiority to the motives that
swayed vulgar minds. The admission of sordid influences,
whether it began with the visit of Balak's
messengers or had been previously allowed, was perhaps
the first great error of his life. And it is so in
the case of every man who has found the strength of
integrity and reached the vision of the true. The
Christian who has held himself free from the entanglements
of the world, refusing to touch its questionable
rewards, or to be influenced by its jealousy and envy,
has what may be called his inspiration, though it lifts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
him to no prophetic height. He has a clear mind, a
clear eye. His own way is plain, and he can also see
the crookedness of paths which others follow and reckon
straight enough. He can go with a firm step and say
fearlessly, "Be ye followers of me." But if the base
considerations of gain and loss, of ease or discomfort,
of the applause or enmity of other men, intrude, if even
in a small way he becomes a man of the world, at once
there is declension. He may not be ambitious nor
covetous. Yet the withdrawal of his mind from its sole
allegiance to God and the righteousness of God tells at
once on his moral vision. It is clouded. The oracle becomes
ambiguous. He hears two voices, many voices;
and the counsels of his mind are confused. Like others,
he now takes a crooked course, he feels that he has
lost the old firmness of speech and action.</p>

<p>It is a sad thing when one who has felt himself
"born to the good, to the perfect," who has gained the
power that comes through reverence, and sees greater
power before him, yields to that which is not venerable,
not pure. The beginnings of the fatal surrender may
be small. Only a throb of self-consciousness and satisfaction
when some one speaks a word of flattery or
with show of much deference prefers an astute request.
Only a disposition to listen when in seeming friendship
counsel of a plausible kind is offered, and milder ways
of judging are recommended to lessen friction and put
an end to discord. Even the strong are so weak,
and those who see are so easily blinded, that no one
can count himself safe. And indeed it is not the
great temptations, like that which came to Balaam, we
have chiefly to dread. The very greatness of a bribe
and magnificence of an opportunity put conscience on
its guard. Peril comes rather when the appeal for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
charity, or the casuistry of protesting virtue, sends
one to reconsider judgment that has been solemnly
pronounced by a voice we cannot mistake; when we
forget that the matter is only rightly determined for
men when it is clearly and irrevocably decided by the
law of God, whatever men may think, however they
may deplore or rebel.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Thou and God exist&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So think!&mdash;for certain; think the mass&mdash;mankind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disparts, disperses, leaves thyself alone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ask thy lone soul what laws are plain to thee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee and no other,&mdash;stand or fall by them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is the part for thee: regard all else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what it may be&mdash;Time's illusion."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Men in their need, in their sorrow, their self-esteem,
would have the true man revoke his judgment, yield a
point at least to their entreaties. He will do them kindness,
he will show himself human, reasonable, judicious.
But on the other side are those to whom, in showing
this consideration, he will be unjust, declaring their
honour worthless, their sore struggle a useless waste
of strength; and he himself stands before the Judge.
The one sure way is that which keeps the life in the
line of the statutes of God, and every judgment in full
accord with His righteousness.</p>

<h2>XIX<br /><br />

<i>BALAAM ON THE WAY</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxii. 20-38</h4>

<p>The history is moving towards a great vindication
of Israel and prediction of its coming power, all
the more impressive that they are to be wrung from an
unwilling witness, a man who would pronounce a curse
rather than a blessing; all the more impressive, too,
because the enemies of Israel will themselves arrange
on a mountain pinnacle the scene of the revelation, with
smoking altars and princely spectators. The great
Actor in the drama is unseen; but His voice is heard.
However tractable the omens may have been under
other circumstances in the hands of the soothsayer,
he now finds a Master. As the story unfolds, Balaam
is seen attempting the impossible, endeavouring to force
the hands of Providence, held as in a chain at every
stage. There is a Power that treats him as if he
were a child. Finally, with most unwilling eloquence,
he is compelled to fling far and wide a challenge to
Israel's enemies, the praises of her rising star.</p>

<p>In harmony with this general movement is the result
of Balaam's second appeal for permission to take the
journey to Moab. He receives it, but with a reservation.
Fear of the great God whom he invokes holds
him to the conviction that whatever he may do no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
word must pass his lips other than Jehovah gives him
to speak. In repeating his inquiry he has assumed
that the God of Israel is amenable to human urgency;
and as he will have Jehovah to be, so within limits
he seems to find Him. Yet there is more to reckon
with than a dubious oracle, discovered through signs
and portents of the sky or whisperings of the breeze at
night. Jehovah has brought His people from Egypt,
fed them in the desert, given them victory. Balaam
finds that this God can send angels upon His errands,
that there is no escape from His presence nor evasion
of His will.</p>

<p>It was in a kind of madness the diviner set out from
Pethor by the way of the Euphrates' ford. Excited
by the hope of gaining the rewards and enjoying the
fame awaiting him in Moab, he was at the same time
conscious of being in opposition to the God of Israel,
and committed to an adventure that might end disastrously.
He went in a mood of wilfulness, hoping and
yet half doubting that his way would become clear,
irritable therefore, ready to resent every hindrance.
A diviner of repute, credited with powers of blessing
and cursing, he perhaps felt himself safe on ordinary
occasions, especially among his own people, even when
he went against those who consulted him. But could
he count on the forbearance of the king of Moab into
whose country he was venturing? Jehovah might be
opening his way only to destruction. Such fears could
hardly be avoided.</p>

<p>And men who have gone back to conscience endeavouring
to extort from it a sanction or permission
previously denied, who, with some half assurance that
the way is open, set out on a desired course, are practically
in the same mad mood, have equal reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
dread the issue. Is this understood? It may be safely
asserted that half the wrong things men do&mdash;taking an
average of human action, half at least&mdash;are done not in
despite of conscience, but with its dubious consent,
when the first clear decision has been set aside. No
doubt the urgency is often very great, as it was in
Balaam's case, and frequently of a less questionable
kind. Not the desire of envious persons to have others
cursed or evil intreated, but possibly the desire of some
to have the shadow of adverse judgment taken away,
may be the plea, and be supported by the promise of
large reward. The first word of conscience is distinct&mdash;Have
nothing whatever to do with the matter: the
shadow has fallen on the wrongdoer; he has not
repented; let him suffer still. But his agents come
with gold and silver, with plausible words, with seeming
Christian arguments. Then the appeal to conscience
is renewed, and he who should be firm in judgment
finds a false permission. Or the case may be of one
in business, tempted to some practice, common enough,
but dishonest, vile. His first feeling has been that of
disgust. He could not for a moment contemplate a
thing so base. But under the pressure of what appears
to be necessity, plausible arguments and pretexts gain
ground. The fact that reputable men find no difficulty
about the matter, the notion that a custom is excusable
because it is followed by most if not by all, along with
other considerations of a personal kind, are allowed to
have some weight, and then to overbalance the sense
of duty. And the result is that the moral atmosphere
is confused. The man sets out on a way which appears
to be opened for him; but he goes under the shadow
of a haunting fear.</p>

<p>Like Balaam, one who thus extorts from conscience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
that is from God, permission to go where he himself
desires, knowing it to be a wrong way, is quite aware,
may indeed be eager to acknowledge to himself, that he
is still held by a Divine command extending over a part
of his conduct. He will not speak a word that shall
be against truth. He will resume friendship with the
rich transgressor; but he will not in words excuse or
palliate his crime. He will adulterate certain commodities
in which he deals, but he will never assert that
they are genuine. This is the tribute to religion and
to conscience that sustains decaying self-respect. By
this the man who passes for a Christian endeavours
to keep himself separate from those who have no
conscience. The most is made of the difference. As
compared with those who unblushingly defend the
wrong, this man may think himself a saint. He
would on no account speak a falsehood. Does he not
fear God? Is he a dog that he should do this
thing? Nevertheless, the way leads into a bottomless
quagmire. For a time the waning light of religion may
shine. It may even burst before it dies into a bright
flame of indignation against sin&mdash;the crimes others
commit&mdash;or of loud protestation against what are called
false charges. But the man dies a Balaam, with a
perverted conscience, and must face the dreadful
result.</p>

<p>Well has it been said that no virtue is safe without
enthusiasm. A man cannot be true to the highest law
unless he has the motive within him of pure devotion
to God as his personal Redeemer, unless he recognises
that his joy in God and his salvation are bound up
with fidelity to the moral ideal which is presented to
him. Faith, hope, love must inspire and keep the soul
in fervour of desire to reach the heights to which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
is called by the Divine voice. But the most of men
come far short of this enthusiasm. It is rather with
reluctance, after a kind of struggle with themselves,
that they look duty in the face. And even when they
do they find no pleasure in resolving to press on where
the absolutely right is seen. Their pleasure lies in
doing less than that. They seek accordingly some
way of observing the letter of duty while they avoid
its spirit. But the sense of having come short in a
matter that involves their highest wellbeing, their
standing before God, their very right to hope and to
live, remains with them. Marriage, for example, is
often entered upon after a struggle with conscience
in which a clear mandate has been set aside. The
desire to please self is allowed to overcome the conviction
that the new bond will keep life on the low
worldly ground, or drag it back from spirituality.
The merely expedient is chosen rather than the ideal
of moral independence and power. And of this come
fretfulness, dissatisfaction with self, with others, with
Providence. All the sophistries that can be used fail
to set the mind at rest. Events continually occur
which throw flashes of light on the past and reveal the
lost hope, the forfeited vision.</p>

<p>God does not make the wrong way smooth for one
who has extorted permission to follow it. A man
desiring to enter on a course which he sees to be
dishonourable or at least dubious may be absolutely
prevented at first. His appeal is to Providence. If
circumstances allowed his plan he would reckon the
Divine will favourable to it. But they do not. Every
door he tries in the direction he wishes to take is
barred against him. Afterwards one yields to pressure,
or is thrown wide because he knocks at it persistently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Then he advances, taking for granted that he has
obtained permission from God. But he does not go
far till he is undeceived. So, Balaam sets out on
his adventure, riding on his ass and attended by his
two servants. Yet he does not get clear of the
vineyards of Pethor without hindrance. Obstacles
to his journey which do not appear in the narrative
may have at first stood in his way, certain political
complications, we may suppose. Now they are removed.
But he is met by others. The angel of the
Lord opposes him, one who stands with a drawn sword
in hand in a hollow way between the vineyards, a
path closely fenced on the one side and the other.
Balaam fails to see the adversary; he is absorbed
in his own thoughts. But the ass sees, and will not
go forward, and as Balaam becomes aware of resistance
his anger is kindled.</p>

<p>The narrative here is confessedly difficult. One of
the most reverent commentators on the passage declares
that he feels too deeply the essential veracity of the
story to be troubled with minute questions about its
details. "I would not," he says, "force them upon
any one's belief merely by uttering the coarse sentence,
that they are in the Bible and therefore must be
received. One is afraid of leading people to fancy
that they do believe what they do not believe, and so
of propagating hypocrisy under the name of faith."
To some the narrative may present no serious difficulty.
They accept it literally at every point. Others again
are not so easily satisfied that the occasion called for
miracles like those which appear on the face of the
history. It seems to them of no great moment whether
Balaam went or did not go to Moab, whether he cursed
Israel or blessed it. Neither the curse nor the blessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of a man of Balaam's sort could make the least
difference to Israel. These readers accordingly would
find a parabolical or pictorial explanation of the incidents.
Literal belief, in any case, need not be made
a test of reverence; the spirit is surely more than the
letter. The point of greatest importance is to believe
that God dealt with this man, opposed his perverse
will by gracious influences and unexpected protests.
To Balaam, no doubt, the angel's appearance and the
ass's rebuke were real, as real and impressive as any
experiences he ever had. He was humbled; he acknowledged
his sin and offered to return. When he
reached the land of Moab, the recollection of what
befell him by the way had a salutary influence on all
he said and did.</p>

<p>In many unforeseen, singular, and often homely ways,
men are checked in the endeavour to carry out the
schemes which ambition and avarice prompt. The
angel of the Lord who opposes one bent on a bad
enterprise often appears in familiar guise. To some
men their wives stand in the way, some are challenged
by their children. What in voluntary blindness they
have declined to see&mdash;the madness of the wrong course,
the intrinsic baseness of the thing undertaken&mdash;those
who look with pure eyes perceive clearly and are brave
enough to condemn. At other times obstacles are
placed in the way by the simple ordinary duties which
claim attention, occupy thought and time, and tend to
bring back the mind to humility and saneness. Yet covetousness
can make men very blind. Under the influence
of it they suppose themselves to be acting cleverly,
while all the time those whom they think they are
outwitting see them posting on the way to bankruptcy
and shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Even a good man may lose his spiritual discrimination
occasionally when he fancies himself called to
curse not Israel but Moab, and sets out in heat upon
the errand. He fails to see that the case of Balaam
is so far parallel to his own that he ought to expect an
angel to oppose him. The critical Balaam who feels
it his high duty to pronounce maledictions on some
theological opponent, not for silver and gold, but for
the cause of God, is resisted by many an angel bearing
the sharp sword of the Word, set to declare the great
tolerance of Christ, and to vindicate the liberty that is
in Him. That men fail to see these angels, or else
ride past them, is abundantly evident, for the altars
smoke on many a height, and scrolls of futile condemnation
are flung upon the breeze.</p>

<p>Balaam smites the ass even when she falls down
under him in her abject terror. He endeavours to
force her on till at last he is put to shame by her
rebuke. We are pointed to the irrational way in which
those act whose moral judgment is blinded. Their
course being wrong, they do not turn against themselves,
but rise in passion against every person or
thing that hinders. The husband who is resolved
to take a wrong path thrusts away his faithful wife;
the son bent on what will be his ruin pushes off his
weeping mother when she pleads before him. Often
an apparently inexplicable fit of temper in public or in
private means that a man is in the wrong and is aware
of a mistake, from the consequences of which he would
fain escape. One's heart bleeds for none more than
for those victims of selfish anger who suffer under the
abuse of the Balaams of society. They have seen the
angel in the way. They have sought by a gesture or
a warning word to arrest the friend who would go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
to evil. Then the cruel strokes fall on them, curses,
foul abuse, taunts often directed against their religion.
They are charged with setting themselves up as holier
and better than other people. They are denounced as
meddlers and fools. They protest without effect often,
and suffer apparently to no purpose. Yet shall we
suppose their endeavours altogether lost? Good is
surely stronger than evil. Every right act and word
is germinal. After long years it bears fruit.</p>

<p>In Balaam's case there was a happier issue than is
often seen. The protest against his cruelty opened his
eyes to the truth that a messenger of God stood in
his way. The rebuke came home to him. So might
a hard, self-willed man who rode rough-shod over the
feelings and rights of others be brought suddenly to a
sense of his cruelty by the look on the face of a dog.
Bad as men and women may be, violent and abusive
as they may become in times of anger and impatience,
there are ways of softening their hearts. They go on
for years attempting to justify themselves in a rough
and selfish course. But who shall say that even the
seeming worst are beyond recovery? When there
appears to be no redeeming feature left in the character,
the crisis may be at hand, the transgressor may be so
taught by the piteous look of a dumb animal that his
infatuation will come to an end. Recoiling from himself
he will acknowledge his perversity and turn to
better thoughts.</p>

<p>How far did Balaam's repentance go? There can
be little doubt the motive of it was the sudden discovery
that the God of Israel was mightier and more observant
than he had imagined; in short, that Jehovah was his
master. Balaam yields, changes his mind, not because
he is in the least degree more disposed to do what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
right, but because he finds the antagonism of God
falling suddenly upon his life. To the angel he says:
"I have sinned: for I knew not that thou stoodest in
the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee,
I will get me back again." This is an acknowledgment
of authority, but not of an obligation into which any
sense of God's goodness enters. It is the sullen
acquiescence of a foiled adventurer, who at the very
outset is made to understand the terms and narrow
limits of his power. He has his knowledge, his vision.
When he set out he intended to use them, if possible,
under such conditions as would secure his own liberty.
He is now made to understand that he is not free. The
angel with the drawn sword will be in Moab before him,
ready to cut him down if he should do or say anything
opposed to the mind of the God of Israel. He is cowed,
not converted.</p>

<p>And so it often is with men who find their schemes
counteracted, and are made to feel their weakness in
presence of the forces of human government, or of the
natural world. Their confession of sin is really a sullen
acknowledgment of impotence. Sift their feelings and
you discover no sense of guilt. They miscalculated,
and they regret having done so, because it is to their
shame. They will go back to make other plans, to lay
the foundations deeper with greater subtlety, and by-and-by,
if they can, to carry out their ideas and gratify
their covetousness and ambition in other ways. Sometimes
indeed it may become clear to a man that his
efforts to advance himself, such as he is, cannot prosper
because Omnipotence is against him. Then acknowledgment
of defeat is confession of despair. Of this
we see an example in the first Napoleon after his final
capture when he was on the voyage to St. Helena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
He had forced his way over obstacles enough, leaving
blood and ruin behind him. But at length the stronger
power came down to meet him, and he knew that the
game was lost. Beneath the seeming acquiescence
there lurked rebellion. He often spoke as a believer
in God; but the God he knew was one he could have
wished to foil. In the island to which he was confined
he schemed desperately to regain his freedom that he
might renew the vain conflict with Providence for his
own glory and the glory of France. "I have sinned:
I will get me back again." Yes. But will it be to lay
other and more cunning plots for self-aggrandisement,
and recover the lost ground by some daring stroke?
Then it will be also to meet other angels, and at the
last the minister who bears the sword of doom.</p>

<p>Balaam will return, confessing himself defeated for
the time. But he learns that he may not. He has
come so far with designs of his own; he must now go
on to Moab to serve the purposes of God. The permission
he wrested, so to speak, from Providence, was
not wrested after all. There are deeper schemes than
Balaam can form, the great far-reaching plans of the
God of Israel, and by these, however unwillingly, the
soothsayer of Pethor is now bound. This journey has
been of his own perverse choosing; now he must
finish it, feeling himself at every point a servant, an
instrument; and if danger and even death await him,
still he must proceed. Easy it is to begin in the craftiness
of human purpose and the foolishness of earthly
hope; but the end is not under the control of him who
begins. There is One who orders all things so that the
gifts of men and their perversity and their wrath shall
all praise Him, shall all be woven into the web of His
evolving purpose, universal, holy, sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a startling thought that in a sense whatever
we begin in pride or self-will, playing, as it were, the
first act of the drama on some stage we ourselves select,
the movement cannot be arrested when we choose.
In one way or another, act after act must proceed to
the very end which God foreordains. Many human purposes
appear to be sharply and completely broken off.
In the midst of his days man hears the call he cannot
disobey. His tools, his hopes, his declared intentions
must be laid aside. But the end is not yet. The
curtain has fallen here. It will be raised again. And
in many unfoldings of Divine purpose we witness
scene after scene, in scene after scene have to play our
part. One who has begun ill may sincerely repent,
and then the development takes a direction which will
be to the glory of Divine grace. That act of repentance
over, another comes, in which the humble thought of the
penitent reveals itself. He is seen a new man, timorous
where he was bold, bold where he was timorous.
Beyond there are other scenes, in which he shall be
found endeavouring to repair the evil he has done, to
gather the poisoned arrows he has strewed about the
world. And the consummation shall be reached when
the task at which he has vainly laboured is completed
for him by Christ, and his recovery and the restitution
he toiled for shall be complete.</p>

<p>But if there is no penitence, still the drama must
go on to its finish. The man resenting, yet unable to
resist, shall do what God requires, what God permits.
He shall attempt to curse, yet be constrained to bless.
He shall in bitterness of anger frame new devices and
carry them out. Then, when the cup of his iniquity
is full, and all is done Providence allows, retribution
shall overtake him. In the thick of battle the sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
of the angel shall smite him to the ground. For each
man, under God's rule, in the midst of the forces He
upholds, there is a destiny, some stages of which we
can trace. Entering on life we of necessity become
subject to great laws which our revolt cannot in the
least affect. And these are moral laws. The seeming
success of the immoral who are intellectually or brutally
strong is within the narrow limits of time and space.
In the breadths of eternity and infinity there is no
strength for any but the good.</p>

<p>There is a purpose of God which Balaam is unwilling
to subserve; and of that the man becomes gradually
aware. When he is met by Balak and his train and
upbraided with his reluctance to come where honours
and rewards are to be had, the soothsayer realises his
peril and begins at once to prepare the Moabite king for
disappointment. "Lo, I am come unto thee," he says:
"have I now any power at all to speak anything?
The word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I
speak." What we see now is a contest between the
influence of Balak, with his power to reward and also
to punish, and the consciousness of a constraint which
had entered deeply into Balaam's mind. The sense
of Jehovah's authority over him on this occasion was
indeed supported by another strong motive which the
diviner never allowed to fall into the background. He
had his reputation to maintain. At whatever hazard,
he must show himself to Moabites, Midianites, Aramæans,
a man who knew the knowledge of the Most
High. The ignorance of Balak is seen in his absurd
hope that for the sake of some bribe of his the prophet
of Pethor will be induced to fling away his fame.</p>

<p>There are things which even money cannot buy.
There is a limit beyond which even a false and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
avaricious man cannot venture for the sake of honours
and rewards. It is a vulgar judgment that every man
has his price. One who is not particularly conscientious
on most occasions will sometimes touch the bounds of
concession and take his stand for what is left, all the
self he has in any true sense. Neither will money buy
nor threats compel his further acquiescence in what he
deems wrong. Again, as in Balaam's case, the limit of
the power of gold or of threats may be fixed by pride.
There are gifts, qualities, distinctions possessed by
some, in virtue of which they seem to themselves to
occupy a place which all might covet. The veteran
has his decoration, once attached to his uniform by
some honoured commander under whom he served.
No money could buy that. He would die rather than
part with it. Another is proud of his name. To
dishonour that would be treachery to his ancestors.
Balaam has his unique power of vision, and for a while
at least he preserves it. A man like Balak, measuring
others by himself, regards a diviner as one of a lower
order who may be moved by menaces and promises.
He finds that Balaam has pride enough to lift him
above them. Thus vanity counteracts vanity; the
comparatively base keeps the base in check.</p>

<h2>XX<br /><br />

<i>BALAAM'S PARABLES</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxii. 39-xxiv. 9</h4>

<p>The scene is now on some mountain of Moab
from which the encampment of the Hebrew tribes
in the plain of the Jordan is fully visible. At Kiriath-huzoth,
possibly the modern Shihan, about ten miles
east of the Dead Sea, and to the south of the Arnon
valley, preparation for the attempt against Israel's
destiny has been made by a great sacrifice of oxen
and sheep intended to secure the good-will of Chemosh,
the Baal or Lord of Moab. On the range overhanging
the Dead Sea, somewhat to the north of the Arnon,
perhaps, are the Bamoth-Baal, or high places of Baal,
and the "bare height" where Balaam is to seek his
auguries and will be met by God.</p>

<p>The evening of Balaam's arrival has been spent in
the sacrificial festival, and in the morning Balak and
his princes escort the diviner to the Bamoth-Baal that
he may begin his experiment. After his usual manner,
Balaam pompously requires that great arrangements
be made for the trial of auguries by means of which
his oracle is to be found. Balak has offered sacrifices
to Chemosh; now Jehovah must be propitiated, and
seven altars have to be built, and on each of them
a bullock and a ram offered by fire. The altars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
erected, the carcases of the animals prepared, Balaam
does not remain beside them to take actual part in the
sacrifice. It is, in fact, to be Balak's, not his; and if
the God of Israel should refuse His sanction to the
curse, that will be because the offering of the king of
Moab has not secured His favour. Accordingly, while
the seven wreaths of smoke ascend from the altars,
and the invocations of the Divine power which usually
accompany sacrifice are chanted by the king and his
princes, the soothsayer withdraws to a peak at some
distance that he may read the omens. "Peradventure,"
he says, "Jehovah will come to meet me."</p>

<p>It was now a critical hour for the ambitious prophet.
He had indeed already found distinction, for who in
Moab or Midian could have commanded with so royal
an air and received attention so obsequious? But the
reward remained to be won. Yet may we not assume
that when Balaam reached Moab and saw the pitiable
state of what had been once a strong kingdom, the
cities half ruined, filled with poor and dejected inhabitants,
he conceived a kind of contempt for Balak and
perceived that his offers must be set aside as worthless?
God met Balaam, we are told. And this may have
been the sense in which God met him and put a word
into his mouth. What was Moab compared with
Israel? A glance at Kiriath-huzoth, a little experience
of Balak's empty boastfulness and the entreaties and
anxiety which betrayed his weakness, would show
Balaam the vanity of proposing to reinvigorate Moab
at the expense of Israel. His way led clearly enough
where the finger of the God of Israel pointed, and his
mind almost anticipated what the Voice he heard as
Jehovah's declared. He saw the smoke streaming
south-eastward, and casting a black shadow between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
him and Moab; but the sun shone on the tents of
Israel, right away to the utmost part of the camp
(xxii. 41). The mind of Balaam was made up. It
would be better for him in a worldly sense to win
some credit with Israel than to have the greatest
honour Moab could offer. Chemosh was in decline,
Jehovah in the ascendant. Perhaps the Hebrews
might need a diviner when their great Moses was dead,
and he, Balaam, might succeed to that exalted office.
We never can tell what dreams will enter the mind of
the ambitious man, or rather, we do not know on what
slender foundations he builds the most extravagant
hopes. There was nothing more unlikely, the thing
indeed was absolutely impossible, yet Balaam may have
imagined that his oracle would come to the ears of
the Israelites, and that they would send for him to give
favourable auguries before they crossed the Jordan.</p>

<p>Rapidly the diviner had to form his decision. That
done, the words of the oracle could be trusted to the
inspiration of the moment, inspiration from Jehovah,
whose superiority to all the gods of Syria Balaam now
heartily acknowledged. He accordingly left his place
of vision and returned to the Bamoth where the altars
still smoked. Then he took up his parable and spoke.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From Aram Balak brought me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Moab's king from the mountains of the east;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Come, curse for me Jacob,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And come, menace Israel.'<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How can I curse whom God hath not cursed?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And how can I menace whom God hath not menaced?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For from the head of the rocks I see him,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And from the hills I behold him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Lo, a people apart he dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And among the nations he is not counted.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who can reckon the dust of Jacob,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
<span class="i1">And in number the fourth of Israel?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let my soul die the death of the righteous;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And be my last end like his!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In this parable, or <i>mashal</i>, along with some elements
of egotism and self-defence, there are others that have
the ring of inspiration. The opening is a vaunt, and
the expression, "How can I curse whom God hath not
cursed?" is a form of self-vindication which savours
of vanity. We see more of the cowed and half-resentful
man than of the prophet. Yet the vision of a people
dwelling apart, not to be reckoned among the others, is
a real revelation, boldly flung out. Something of the
difference already established between Israel and the
<i>goim</i>, or peoples of the Syrian district, had been caught
by the seer in his survey of past events, and now came
to clear expression. For a moment, at least, his soul
rose almost into spiritual desire in the cry that his last
end should be of the kind an Israelite might have; one
who with calm confidence laid himself down in the arms
of the great God, the Lord of providence, of death as
well as life.</p>

<p>A man has learned one lesson of great value for the
conduct of life when he sees that he cannot curse whom
God has not cursed, that he would be foolish to menace
whom God has not menaced. Reaching this point of
sight, Balaam stands superior for the time to the vulgar
ideas of men like the king of Moab, who have no conception
of a strong and dominant will to which human
desires are all subjected. However reluctantly this
confession is made, it prevents many futile endeavours
and much empty vapouring. There are some indeed
whose belief that fate must be on their side is simply
immovable. Those whom they choose to reckon enemies
are established in the protection of heaven; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
think it possible to wrest their revenge even from the
Divine hand. Not till the blow they strike recoils with
crushing force on themselves do they know the fatuity
of their hope. In his "Instans Tyrannus" Mr. Browning
pictures one whose persecution of an obscure foe ends
in defeat.</p>

<p>In smaller matters, the attempts at impudent detraction
which are common, when the base, girding at
the good, think it possible to bring them to contempt,
or at least stir them to unseemly anger, or prick
them to humiliating self-defence, the law is often well
enough understood, yet neither the assailants nor those
attacked may be wise enough to recognise it. A man
who stands upon his faithfulness to God does not need
to be vexed by the menaces of the base; he should despise
them. Yet he often allows himself to be harassed,
and so yields all the victory hoped for by his detractor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Calm indifference, if one has a right to use it, is the
true shield against the arrows of envy and malice.</p>

<p>Balaam's vision of Israel as a separated people, a
people dwelling alone, had singular penetration. The
others he knew&mdash;Amorites, Moabites, Ammonites,
Midianites, Hittites, Aramæans&mdash;went together, scarcely
distinguishable in many respects, with their national
Baals all of the same kind. Was Ammon or Chemosh,
Melcarth or Sutekh, the name of the Baal? The rites
might differ somewhat, there might be more or less
ferocity ascribed to the deities; but on the whole their
likeness was too close for any real distinction. And
the peoples, differing in race, in culture, in habit, no
doubt, were yet alike in this, that their morality and
their mental outlook passed no boundary, were for the
most part of the beaten, crooked road. Strifes and
petty ambitions here and there, temporary combinations
for ignoble ends, the rise of one above another
for a time under some chief who held his ground by
force of arms, then fell and disappeared&mdash;such were
the common events of their histories. But Israel came
into Balaam's sight as a people of an entirely different
kind, generically distinct. Their God was no Baal
ferocious by report, really impotent, a mere reflection
of human passion and lust. Jehovah's law was a
creation, like nothing in human history ascribed to a
God. His worship meant solemn obligation, imposed,
acknowledged, not simply to honour Him, but to be
pure and true and honest in honouring Him. Israel
had no part in the orgies that were held in professed
worship of the Baals, really to the disgrace of their
devotees. The lines of the national development had
been laid down, and Balaam saw to some extent how
widely they diverged from those along which other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
peoples sought power and glory. Amorites and Hittites
and Canaanites might keep their place, but Israel had
the secret of a progress of which they never dreamed.
Wherever the tribes settled, when they advanced to
fulfil their destiny, they would prove a new force in
the world.</p>

<p>For the time Israel might be called the one spiritual
people. It was this Balaam partly saw, and made the
basis of his striking predictions. The modern nations
are not to be distinguished by the same testing idea.
The thoughts and hopes of Christianity have entered
more or less into all that are civilised, and have touched
others that can scarcely be called so. Yet if there is
any oracle for the peoples of our century it is one that
turns on the very point which Balaam seems to have
had in view. But it is, that not one of them, as a
nation, is distinctly moved and separated from others
by spirituality of aim. Of not one can it be said that
it is confessedly, eagerly, on the way to a Canaan
where the Living and True God shall be worshipped,
that its popular movements, its legislation, its main
endeavours look to such a heavenly result. If we saw
a people dwelling apart, with a high spiritual aim,
resolutely excluding those ideas of materialism which
dominate the rest, of them it would not be presumptuous
to prophesy in the high terms to which the oracles of
Balaam gradually rose.</p>

<p>Regarding the wish with which the diviner closed his
first <i>mashal</i>, hard things have been said, as for example,
that "even in his sublimest visions his egotism breaks
out; in the sight of God's Israel he cries, 'Let me die
the death of the righteous.'" Here, however, there
may be personal sorrow and regret, a pathetic confession
of human fear by one who has been brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
to serious thought, rather than any mere egoistic
craving. Why should he speak of death? That is
not the theme of the egotist. We hear a sudden
ejaculation that seems to open a glimpse of his heart.
For this man, like every son of Adam, has his burden,
his secret trouble, from which all the hopes and plans
of his ambition cannot relieve his mind. Now for the
first time he speaks in a genuinely religious strain.
"There are the righteous whom the Great Jehovah
regards with favour, and gathers to Himself. When
their end comes they rest. Alas! I, Balaam, am not
one of them; and the shadows of my end are not far
away! Would that by some mighty effort I could
throw aside my life as it has been and is, revoke my
destiny, and enter the ranks of Jehovah's people&mdash;were
it only to die among them."</p>

<p>Wistfully, men whose life has been on the low
ground of mere earthly toil and pleasure may, in like
manner, when the end draws near, envy the confidence
and hope of the good. For the old age of the sensualist,
and even of the successful man of the world, is under a
dull wintry sky, with no prospect of another morning,
or even of a quiet night of dreamless sleep.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The weariest and most loathed worldly life,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Can lay on nature, is a paradise<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To what we fear of death."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Courage and peace at the last belong to those alone
who have kept in the way of righteousness. To them
and no others light shall arise in the darkness. The
faithfulness of God is their refuge even when the last
shadows fall. He whom they trust goes before them
in the pillar of fire when night is on the world, as well
as in the pillar of cloud by day. To the man of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
earth even the falling asleep of the good is enviable,
though they may not anticipate a blessed immortality.
Their very grave is a bed of peaceful rest, for living or
dying they belong to the great God.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>It was with growing dissatisfaction, rising to anxiety,
Balak heard the first oracle that fell from the diviner's
lips. Despite the warning he had received that only
the words which Jehovah gave should be spoken,
he hoped for some kind of a curse. His altars had
been built, his oxen and rams sacrificed, and surely,
he thought, all would not be in vain! Balaam had not
travelled from Pethor to mock him. But the prophecy
carried not a single word of heartening to the enemies
of Israel. The camp lay in the full sunshine of
fortune, unobscured by the least cloud. It was the
first blow to Balak's malignant jealousy, and might
well have put him to confusion. But men of his sort
are rich in conjectures and expedients. He had set
his mind on this as the means of finding advantage
in a struggle that was sure to come; and he clung
to his hope. Although the curse would not light on
the whole camp of Israel, yet it might fall on a part,
the remote outlying portion of the tribes. In superstition
men are for ever catching at straws. If the
anger of some heavenly power, what power mattered
little to Balak, could be once enlisted against the tribes,
even partially, the influence of it might spread. And
it would at least be something if pestilence or lightning
smote the utmost part of that threatening encampment.</p>

<p>One must be sorry for men whose impotent anger
has to fall on expedients so miserably inadequate.
Moab defeated by the Amorites sees them in turn
vanquished and scattered by this host which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
suddenly appeared, and to all ordinary reckoning has
no place nor right in the region. Sad as was the
defeat which deprived Balak of half his land and left
his people in poverty, this incursion and its success
foreboded greater trouble. The king was bound to
do something, and, feeling himself unable to fight, this
was his scheme. The utter uselessness of it from
every point of view gives the story a singular pathos.
But the world under Divine providence cannot be
left in a region where superstition reigns and progress
is impossible&mdash;simply that a people like the
Moabites may settle again on their lees, and that
others may continue to enjoy what seem to them to
be their rights. There must be a stirring of human
existence, a new force and new ideas introduced
among the peoples, even at the expense of war and
bloodshed. And our sympathy with Balak fails when we
recollect that Israel had refrained from attacking Moab
in its day of weakness, had even refrained from asking
leave to pass through its impoverished territory. The
feelings of the vanquished had been respected. Perhaps
Balak, with the perversity of a weak man and an
incompetent prince, resented this as much as anything.</p>

<p>Balaam was now brought into the field of Zophim,
or the Watchers, to the "top of Pisgah," whence he
could see only a part of the camp of Israel. The
Hebrew here as well as in xxii. 41 is ambiguous.
It has even been interpreted as meaning that on the
first occasion part of the encampment only was in
view, and on the second occasion the whole of it
(so Keil <i>in loco</i>). But the tenor of the narrative
corresponds better with the translation given in the
English Version. The precise spot here called the
top of Pisgah has not been identified. In the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of some the name Pisgah survives in the modern
Siaghah; but even if it does we are not helped in the
least. Others take Pisgah as meaning simply "hill,"
and read "the field of Zophim on the top of the hill."
The latter translation would obviate the difficulty that
in Deut. xxxiv. 1 it is said that Moses, when the time
of his death approached, "went up from the plains
of Moab unto Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah that
is over against Jericho." Pisgah may have been the
name of the range; yet again in Numb. xxvii. 12,
and Deut. xxxii. 49, Abarim is given as the name of
the range of which Nebo is a peak. We are led to
the conclusion that Pisgah was the name in general
use for a hill-top of some peculiar form. The root
meaning of the word is difficult to make out. It may
at all events be taken as certain that this top of Pisgah
is not the same as that to which Moses ascended to
die. Balak and his princes had not as yet ventured
so far beyond the Arnon.</p>

<p>At Balaam's request the same arrangements were
made as at Bamoth-Baal. Seven altars were built,
and seven bullocks and seven rams were offered; and
again the diviner withdrew to some distance to seek
omens. This time his meeting with Jehovah gave
him a more emphatic message. It would seem that
with the passing of the day's incidents the vatic fire
in his mind burned more brightly. Instead of endeavouring
to conciliate Balak he appears to take
delight in the oracle that dashes the hopes of Moab to
the ground. He has looked from the new point of
vision and seen the great future that awaits Israel.
It is vain to expect that the decree of the Almighty
One can be revoked. Balak must hear all that the
spirit of Elohim has given to the seer.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The confirmation of the first oracle by what Balaam
has realised on his second approach to Jehovah compels
the question which rebukes the king's vain desire.
"Hath He said, and shall He not do it?" Balak
did not know Jehovah as Balaam knew Him. This
God never went back from His decision, nor recalled
His promises. And He is able to do whatever He
wills. Not only does He refuse to curse Israel, but
He has given a blessing which Balaam even, powerful
as he is, cannot possibly hinder. It has become
manifest that the judgment of God on His people's
conduct is in no respect adverse. Reviewing their
past, the diviner may have found such failure from the
covenant as would give cause for a decision against
them, partial at least, if not general. But there is no
excuse for supposing that Jehovah has turned against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the tribes. Their recent successes and present position
are proofs of His favour unrevoked, and, it would seem,
irrevocable. There is a King with this people, and
when they advance it is with a shout in His honour.
The King is Jehovah their God; mightier far than
Balak or any ruler of the nations. When the loud
Hallelujah rose from the multitude at some sacred
feast, it was indeed the shout of a monarch.</p>

<p>Singular is it to find a diviner like Balaam noting as
one of the great distinctions of Israel that the nation
used neither augury nor divination. The hollowness
of his own arts in presence of the God of Israel
who could not be moved by them, who gave His
people hope without them, would seem to have impressed
Balaam profoundly. He speaks almost as if
in contempt of the devices he himself employs. Indeed,
he sees that his art is not art at all, as regards Israel.
The Hebrews trust no omens; and either for or against
them omens give no sign. It was another mark of
the separateness of Israel. Jehovah had fenced His
people from the spells of the magician. True to Him,
they could defy all the sorcery of the East. And when
the time for further endeavour came, the nations around
should have to hear of the God who had brought the
Hebrew tribes out of Egypt. With a lion-like vigour
they would rise from their lair by the Jordan. The
Canaanites and Amorites beyond should be their prey.
Already perhaps tidings had come of the defeat of
Bashan: the cities on the other side Jordan should
fall in their turn.</p>

<p>As yet there is nothing in the predictions of Balaam
that can be said to point distinctly to any future event
in Israel's history. The oracles are of that general
kind which might be expected from a man of the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
who has given attention to the signs of the times and
perceived the value to a people of strong and original
faith. But taking them in this sense they may well
rebuke that modern disbelief which denies the inspiring
power of religion and the striking facts which come
to light not only in the history of nations like Israel
but in the lives of men whose vigour springs from
religious zeal. Balaam saw what any whose eyes
are open will also see, that when the shout of the
Heavenly King is among a people, when they serve a
Divine Master, holy, just, and true, they have a standing
ground and an outlook not otherwise to be reached.
The critics of religion who take it to be a mere heat of
the blood, a transient emotion, forget that the grasp
of great and generous principles, and the thought of an
Eternal Will to be served, give a sense of right and
freedom which expediency and self-pleasing cannot
supply. However man comes to be what he is, this is
certain, that for him strength depends not so much on
bodily physique as on the soul, and for the soul on
religious inspiration. The enthusiasm of pleasure-seeking
has never yet made a band of men indomitable,
nor need it be expected to give greatness; we cannot
persuade ourselves that apart from God our blessedness
is a matter of surpassing importance. We are
a multitude whose individual lives are very small, very
short, very insignificant, unless they are known to
serve some Divine end.</p>

<p>It has been seen by one philosopher that if the
religious sanction be taken away from morality some
other must be provided to fill up the vacuum. Further,
it may be said that if the religious support and stimulus
of human energy be withdrawn there will be a greater
vacuum more difficult to fill. The would-be benefactors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
of our race, who think that the superstition of a personal
God is effete and should be swept away as soon as
possible, so that man may return to nature, might do
well to return to Balaam. He had a penetration which
they do not possess. And singularly, the very apostle
of that impersonal "stream of tendency making for
righteousness," which was once to be put in the place
of God, did on one occasion unwittingly remind us of
this prophet. Mr. Matthew Arnold had a difficult thing
to do when he tried to encourage a toiling population
to go on toiling without hope, to plod on in the underground
while a select few above enjoyed the sunlight.
The part was that of a diviner finding auguries for the
inevitable. But he spoke as one who had to pity a
poor blind Israel, no longer inspired by the shout of a
king or the hope of a promised land, an Israel that
had lost its faith and its way and seemed about to
perish in the desert. Well did he know how difficult
it is for men under this dread to endure patiently when
those above have abolished God and the future life;
men, who are disposed to say, yet must be told that
they say vainly, "If there is nothing but this life, we
must have it. Let us help ourselves, whenever we
can, to all we desire." Was that Israel to be blessed
or cursed? There was no oracle. Yet the cultured
Balak, hoping for a spell at least against the revolutionaries,
had a rebuke. The prophet did not curse;
he had no power to bless. But Moab was shown to
be in peril, was warned to be generous.</p>

<p>Balaams enough there are, after a sort, with more
or less penetration and sincerity. But what the peoples
need is a Moses to revive their faith. The hollow
maledictions and blessings that are now launched
incessantly from valley to hill, from hill to valley, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
be silenced if we found the leader who can re-awaken
faith. It would be superfluous, then, for the race
in its fresh hope to bless itself, and vain for the
pessimists to curse it. With the ensign of Divine
love leading the way, and the new heavens and earth
in view, all men would be assured and hopeful, patient
in suffering, fearless in death.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The second oracle produced in the mind of Balak
an effect of bewilderment, not of complete discomfiture.
He appears to be caught so far in the afflatus that
he must hear all the prophet has to tell. He desires
Balaam neither to curse nor bless; neutrality
would be something. Yet, with all he has already
heard giving clear indication what more is to be
expected, he proposes another place, another trial of
the auguries. This time the whole of Israel shall
again be seen. The top of Peor that looketh down
upon Jeshimon, or the desert, is chosen. On this
occasion when the altars and sacrifices are prepared
the order is not the same as before. The diviner does
not retire to a distance to seek for omens. He makes
no profession of mystery now. The temperature of
thought and feeling is high, for the spot on which the
company gathers is almost within range of the sentinels
of Israel. The adventure is surely one of the
strangest which the East ever witnessed. In the
dramatic unfolding of it the actors and spectators
are alike absorbed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The third prophetic chant repeats several of the
expressions contained in the second, and adds little;
but it is more poetical in form. The prophet standing
on the height saw "immediately below him the vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
encampment of Israel amongst the acacia groves of
Abel Shittim&mdash;like the water-courses of the mountains,
like the hanging gardens beside his own river
Euphrates, with their aromatic shrubs and their wide-spreading
cedars. Beyond them on the western side
of Jordan rose the hills of Palestine, with glimpses
through their valleys of ancient cities towering on their
crested heights. And beyond all, though he could
not see it with his bodily vision, he knew well that
there rolled the deep waters of the great sea, with the
Isles of Greece, the Isle of Chittim&mdash;a world of which
the first beginnings of life were just stirring, of which
the very name here first breaks upon our ears." From
the deep meditation which passed into a trance the
diviner awoke to gaze for a little upon that scene, to
look fixedly once more on the camp of the Hebrew
tribes, and then he began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Balaam the son of Beor saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the man whose eye was closed saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He saith who heareth the words of El,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who seeth the vision of Shaddai,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Falling down and having his eyes opened."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus in the consciousness of an exalted state of mind
which has come with unusual symptoms, the ecstasy that
overpowers and brings visions before the inward eye,
he vaunts his inspiration. There is no small resemblance
to the manner in which the afflatus came to seers
of Israel in after-times; yet the description points
more distinctly to the rapture of one like King Saul,
who has been swept by some temporary enthusiasm
into a strain of thought, an emotional atmosphere,
beyond ordinary experience. The far-reaching encampment
is first poetically described, with images
that point to perennial vitality and strength. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
as a settled nation Israel is described, irrigating
broad fields and sowing them to reap an abundant
harvest. Why comparison is made between the power
of Israel and Agag one can only guess. Perhaps the
reigning chief of the Amalekites was at this time
distinguished by the splendour of his court, so that his
name was a type of regal magnificence. The images
of the wild ox and the lion are repeated with additional
emphasis; and the strain rises to its climax in the
closing apostrophe:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Blessed be every one that blesseth thee<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And cursed be every one that curseth thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So strongly is Israel established in the favour of
Shaddai, the Almighty One, that attempts to injure her
will surely recoil on the head of the aggressor. And
on the other hand, to help Israel, to bid her God-speed,
will be a way to blessedness. Jehovah will make the
overflowing of His grace descend like rain on those
who take Israel's part and cheer her on her way.</p>

<p>In the light of what afterwards took place, it is clear
that Balaam was in this last ejaculation carried far beyond
himself. He may have seen for a moment, in the
flash of a heavenly light, the high distinction to which
Israel was advancing. He certainly felt that to curse
her would be perilous, to bless her meritorious. But
the thought, like others of a more spiritual nature,
did not enter deeply into his mind. Balaam could
utter it with a kind of strenuous cordiality, and then
do his utmost to falsify his own prediction. What
matter fine emotions and noble protestations if they
are only momentary and superficial? Balak's open
jealousy and hatred of Israel were, after all, more complimentary
to her than the high-sounding praises of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Balaam, who spoke as enjoying the elation of the
prophet, not as delighting in the tenor of his message.
Israel was nothing to him. Soon the prosperity to
which she was destined became like gall and wormwood
to his soul. The encampment roused his admiration at
the time, but afterwards, when it became clear that the
Israelites would have none of him, his mood changed
towards them. Ambition ruled him to the end; and
if the Hebrews did not offer in any way to minister
to it, a man like Balaam would by-and-by set himself
to bring down their pride. Weak humanity gives
many examples of this. The man who has been an
expectant flatterer of one greater than himself, but is
denied the notice and honour he looks for, becomes,
when his hopes have finally to be renounced, the most
savage assailant, the most bitter detractor of his former
hero. And so strong often are the minds which fall
in this manner, that we look sometimes with anxiety
even to the highest.</p>

<h2>XXI<br /><br />

<i>THE MATTER OF BAAL-PEOR</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxiv. 10-xxv. 18</h4>

<p>The last oracle of Balaam, as we have it, ventures
into far more explicit predictions than the others,
and passes beyond the range of Hebrew history. Its
chief value for the Israelites lay in what was taken to
be a Messianic prophecy contained in it, and various
bold denunciations of their enemies. Whether the
language can bear the important meanings thus found
in it is a matter of considerable doubt. On the whole,
it appears best not to make over-much of the prescience
of this <i>mashal</i>, especially as we cannot be sure that we
have it in the original form. One fact may be given to
prove this. In Jeremiah xlviii. 45, an oracle regarding
Moab embodies various fragments of the Book of
Numbers, and one clause seems to be a quotation from
chap. xxiv. 17. In Numbers the reading is, "and
break down &#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1512;, all the sons of tumult &#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1514;;" in
Jeremiah it is, "and the crown of the head &#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1469;&#1465;&#1491; of
the sons of tumult &#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;." The resemblance leaves
little doubt of the derivation of the one expression from
the other, and at the same time shows diversity in the
text.</p>

<p>The earlier deliverances of Balaam had disappointed
the king of Moab; the third kindled his anger. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
was intolerable that one called to curse his enemies
should bless them again and again. Balaam would do
well to get him back to his own place. That Jehovah
of whom he spake had kept him from honour. If he
delayed he might find himself in peril. But the
diviner did not retire. The word that had come to him
should be spoken. He reminded Balak of the terms
on which he had begun his auguries, and, perhaps to
embitter Moab against Israel, persisted in advertising
Balak "what this people should do to his people in the
latter days."</p>

<p>The opening was again a vaunt of his high authority
as a seer, one who knew the knowledge of Shaddai.
Then, with ambiguous forms of speech covering the
indistinctness of his outlook, he spoke of one whom he
saw far away, in imagination, not reality, a personage
bright and powerful, who should rise star-like out of
Jacob, bearing the sceptre of Israel, who should smite
through the corners of Moab and break down the sons
of tumult. Over Edom and Seir he should triumph,
and his dominion should extend to the city which had
become the last refuge of a hostile people. Of spiritual
power and right there is not a trace in this prediction.
It is unquestionably the military vigour of Israel
gathered up into the headship of some powerful king
Balaam sees on the horizon of his field of view. But
he anticipates with no uncertainty that Moab shall be
attacked and broken, and that the victorious leader shall
even penetrate to the fastnesses of Edom and reduce
them. A people like Israel, with so great vitality,
would not be content to have jealous enemies upon its
very borders, and Balak is urged to regard them with
more hatred and fear than he has yet shown.</p>

<p>The view that this prophecy "finds its preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
fulfilment in David, in whom the kingdom was established,
and by whose victories the power of Moab
and Edom was broken, but its final and complete
fulfilment only in Christ," is supported by the unanimous
belief of the Jews, and has been adopted by the
Christian Church. Yet it must be allowed that the
victories of David did not break the power of Moab
and Edom, for these peoples are found again and
again, after his time, in hostile attitude to Israel.
And it is not to the purpose to say that in Christ
the kingdom reaches perfection, that He destroys the
enemies of Israel. Nor is there an argument for the
Messianic reference worth considering in the fact that
the pseudo-Messiah in the reign of Hadrian styled
himself Bar-cochba, son of the star. A pretender to
Messiahship might snatch at any title likely to secure
for him popular support; his choice of a name proves
only the common belief of the Jews, and that was
very ignorant, very far from spiritual. There is
indeed more force in the notion that the star by which
the wise men of the East were guided to Bethlehem
is somehow related to this prophecy. Yet that also is
too imaginative. The oracle of Balaam refers to the
virility and prospective dominance of Israel, as a
nation favoured by the Almighty and destined to be
strong in battle. The range of the prediction is not
nearly wide enough for any true anticipation of a
Messiah gaining universal sway by virtue of redeeming
love. It is becoming more and more necessary
to set aside those interpretations which identify the
Saviour of the world with one who smites and breaks
down and destroys, who wields a sceptre after the
manner of oriental despots.</p>

<p>In Balaam's vision small nations with which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
happens to be acquainted bulk largely&mdash;the Kenites,
Amalek, Moab, and Edom. To him the Amalekites
appear as having once been "the first of the nations."
We may explain, as before, that he had been impressed
on some occasion by what he had seen of their force
and the royal state of their king. The Kenites,
dwelling either among the cliffs of Engedi or the
mountains of Galilee, were a very small tribe; and the
Amalekites, as well as the people of Moab and Edom,
were of little account in the development of human
history. At the same time the prophecy looks in one
direction to a power destined to become very great,
when it speaks of the ships of Chittim. The course
of empire is seen to be westward. Asshur, or Assyria,
and Eber&mdash;the whole Abrahamic race, perhaps, including
Israel&mdash;are threatened by this rising power,
the nearest point of which is Cyprus in the Great Sea.
Balaam is, we may say, a political prophet: to class
him among those who testified of Christ is to exalt
far too much his inspiration and read more into
his oracles than they naturally contain. There is no
deep problem in the narrative regarding him&mdash;as, for
instance, how a man false at heart could in any sense
enter into those gracious purposes of God for the
human race which were fulfilled by Christ.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Balaam, we are told, "rose up and returned to his
own place"; and from this it would seem that with
bitterness in his heart he betook himself to Pethor.
If he did so, vainly hoping still that Israel would
appeal to him, he soon returned to give Balak and
the Midianites advice of the most nefarious kind.
We learn from xxxi. 16, that through his counsel
the Midianite women caused the children of Israel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
commit trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor.
The statement is a link between chaps. xxiv. and xxv.
Vainly had Balaam as a diviner matched himself
against the God of Israel. Resenting his defeat, he
sought and found another way which the customs of
his own people in their obscure idolatrous rites too
readily suggested. The moral law of Jehovah and
the comparative purity of the Israelites as His people
kept them separate from the other nations, gave
them dignity and vigour. To break down this
defence would make them like the rest, would withdraw
them from the favour of their God and even
defeat His purposes. The scheme was one which
only the vilest craft could have conceived; and it
shows us too plainly the real character of Balaam.
He must have known the power of the allurements
which he now advised as the means of attack on those
he could not touch with his maledictions nor gain by
his soothsaying. In the shadow of this scheme of his
we see the diviner and all his tribe, and indeed the
whole morality of the region, at their very worst.</p>

<p>The tribes were still in the plain of Jordan; and we
may suppose that the victorious troops had returned
from the campaign against Bashan, when a band of
Midianites, professing the utmost friendliness, gradually
introduced themselves into the camp. Then began the
temptation to which the Midianitish women, some of
them of high rank, willingly devoted themselves. It
was to impurity and idolatry, to degradation of manhood
in body and soul, to abjuration at once of faith
and of all that makes individual and social life. The
orgies with which the Midianites were familiar belonged
to the dark side of a nature-cultus which
carried the distinction between male and female into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
religious symbolism, and made abject prostration of
life before the Divinity a crowning act of worship.
Surviving still, the same practices are in India and
elsewhere the most dreadful and inveterate barriers
which the Gospel and Christian civilisation encounter.
The Israelites were assailed unexpectedly, it would
appear, and in a time of comparative inaction. Possibly,
also, the camp was composed to some extent of men
whose families were still in Kadesh waiting the conquest
of the land of Canaan to cross the border. But the
fact need not be concealed that the polygamy which
prevailed among the Hebrews was an element in their
danger. That had not been forbidden by the law; it
was even countenanced by the example of Moses. The
custom, indeed, was one which at the stage of development
Israel had reached implied some progress; for
there are conditions even worse than polygamy against
which it was a protest and safeguard. But like every
other custom falling short of the ideal of the family, it
was one of great peril; and now disaster came. The
Midianites brought their sacrifices and slew them;
the festival of Baal-peor was proclaimed. "The people
did eat and bowed down to their gods." It was a
transgression which demanded swift and terrible
judgment. The chief men of the tribes who had joined
in the abominable rites were taken and "hanged up
before the Lord against the sun"; the "judges of
Israel" were commanded to slay "every one his men
that were joined unto Baal-peor."</p>

<p>The narrative of the "Priests' Code," beginning at
ver. 6, and going on to the close of the chapter, adds
details of the sin and its punishment. Assuming that
the row of stakes with their ghastly burden is in full
view, and the dead bodies of those slain by the executioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
are lying about the camp, this narrative shows
the people gathered at the tent of meeting, many of
them in tears. There is a plague, too, which is rapidly
spreading and carrying off the transgressors. In the
midst of the sorrow and wailing, when the chief men
should have been bowed down in repentance, one of
the princes of Simeon is seen leading by the hand his
Midianitish paramour, herself a chief's daughter. In
the very sight of Moses and the people the guilty persons
enter a tent. Then Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest,
following them, inflicts with a javelin the punishment
of death. It is a daring but a true deed; and for it
Phinehas and his seed after him are promised the
"covenant of peace," even the "covenant of an everlasting
priesthood." His swift stroke has vindicated
the honour of God, and "made an atonement for the
children of Israel." An act like this, when the elemental
laws of morality are imperilled and a whole people
needs a swift and impressive lesson, is a tribute to God
which He will reward and remember. True, one of
the priestly house should keep aloof from death. But
the emergency demands immediate action, and he who
is bold enough to strike at once is the true friend of
men and of God.</p>

<p>The question may be put, whether this is not
justice of too rude and ready a kind to be praised in
the name of religion. To some it may seem that the
honour of God could not be served by the deed attributed
to Phinehas; that he acted in passion rather
than in the calm deliberation without which justice
cannot be dealt out by man to man. Would not this
excuse the passionate action of a crowd, impatient of
the forms of law, that hurries an offender to the nearest
tree or lamp-post? And the answer cannot be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Israel was so peculiarly under covenant to God that
its necessity would exonerate a deed otherwise illegal.
We must face the whole problem alike of personal and
of united action for the vindication of righteousness in
times of widespread license.</p>

<p>It is not necessary now to slay an offender in order
clearly and emphatically to condemn his crime. In that
respect modern circumstances differ from those we are
discussing. Upon Israel, as it was at the time of this
tragedy, no impression could have been made deep and
swift enough for the occasion otherwise than by the act
of Phinehas. But for an offender of the same rank now,
there is a punishment as stern as death, and on the
popular mind it produces a far greater effect&mdash;publicity,
and the reprobation of all who love their fellowmen and
God. The act of Phinehas was not assassination; a
similar act now would be, and it would have to be
dealt with as a crime. The stroke now is inflicted by
public accusation, which results in public trial and
public condemnation. From the time to which the
narrative refers, on to our own day, social conditions
have been passing through many phases. Occasionally
there have been circumstances in which the swift judgment
of righteous indignation was justifiable, though it
did seem like assassination. And in no case has such
action been more excusable than when the purity of
family life has been invaded, while the law of the land
would not interfere. We do not greatly wonder that
in France the avenging of infidelity is condoned when
the sufferer snatches a justice otherwise unattainable.
That is not indeed to be praised, but the imperfection
of law is a partial apology. The higher the standard
of public morality the less needful is this venture on
the Divine right to kill. And certainly it is not private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
revenge that is ever to be sought, but the vindication
of the elemental righteousness on which the well-being
of humanity depends. Phinehas had no private revenge
to seek. It was the public good.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>It is confidently affirmed by Wellhausen that the
"Priestly Code" makes the cultus the principal thing,
and this, he says, implies retrogression from the earlier
idea. The passage we are considering, like many
others ascribed to the "Priests' Code," makes something
else than the cultus the principal thing. We are
told that in the teaching of this code "the bond between
cultus and sensuality is severed; no danger can
arise of an admixture of impure, immoral elements, a
danger which was always present in Hebrew antiquity."
But here the danger is admitted, the cultus is entirely
out of sight, and the sin of sensuality is conspicuous.
When Phinehas intervenes, moreover, it is not in
harmony with any statute or principle laid down in the
"Priests' Code"&mdash;rather, indeed, against its general
spirit, which would prohibit an Aaronite from a deed
of blood. According to the whole tenor of the law
the priesthood had its duties, carefully prescribed,
by doing which faithfulness was to be shown. Here
an act of spontaneous zeal, done not "on the positive
command of a will outside," but on the impulse
arising out of a fresh occasion,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> receives the approval
of Jehovah, and the "covenant of an everlasting priesthood"
is confirmed for the sake of it. Was Phinehas
in any sense carrying out statutory instructions for
atonement on behalf of Israel when he inflicted the
punishment of death on Zimri and his paramour?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
To identify the "Priestly Code" with "cultus legislation,"
and that with theocracy, and then declare the
cultus to have become a "pedagogic instrument of
discipline," "estranged from the heart," is to make
large demands on our inattention.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>In the closing verses of the chapter another question
of a moral nature is involved. It is recorded that
after the events we have considered Jehovah spake
unto Moses, saying, "Vex the Midianites, and smite
them; for they vex you with their wiles, wherewith
they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and
in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince
of Midian, their sister, which was slain on the day
of the plague in the matter of Peor." Now is it for
the sake of themselves and their own safety the
Israelites are to smite Midian? Is retaliation commanded?
Does God set enmity between the one
people and the other, and so doing make confession
that Israel has no duty of forgiveness, no mission to
convert and save?</p>

<p>There is difficulty in pronouncing judgment as to
the point of view taken by the narrator. Some will
maintain that the historian here, whoever he was,
had no higher conception of the command than that
it was one which sanctioned revenge. And there
is nothing on the face of the narrative which can be
brought forward to disprove the charge. Yet it must
be remembered that the history proceeds on the
theocratic conception of Israel's place and destiny.
To the writer Israel is of less account in itself than
as a people rescued from Egypt and called to nationality
in order to serve Jehovah. The whole tenor of the
"Priests' Code" narrative as well as of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
bears this out. There is no patriotic zeal in the
narrow sense,&mdash;"My country right or wrong." Scarcely
a passage can be pointed to implying such a sentiment,
such a drift of thought. The underlying idea in the
whole story is the sacredness of morality, not of
Israel; and the suppression or extinction of this tribe
of Midianites with their obscene idolatry is God's
will, not Israel's. Too plain, indeed, is it that the
Israelites would have preferred to leave Midian and
other tribes of the same low moral cast unmolested,
free to pursue their own ends.</p>

<p>And Jehovah is not revengeful, but just. The
vindication of morality at the time the Book of Numbers
deals with, and long afterwards, could only be through
the suppression of those who were identified with
dangerous forms of vice. The forces at command in
Israel were not equal to the task of converting; and
what could be achieved was commanded&mdash;opposition,
enmity; if need were, exterminating war. The better
people has a certain spiritual capacity, but not enough
to make it fit for what may be called moral missionary
work. It would suffer more than it would gain if it
entered on any kind of intercourse with Midian with
the view of raising the standard of thought and life.
All that can be expected meanwhile is that the Israelites
shall be at issue with a people so degraded;
they are to be against the Midianites, keep them from
power in the world, subject them by the sword.</p>

<p>Our judgment, then, is that the narrative sustains
a true theocracy in this sense, exhibits Israel as a
unique phenomenon in human history, not impossible,&mdash;there
lies the clear veracity of the Bible accounts,&mdash;but
playing a part such as the times allowed, such as
the world required. From a passage like that now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
before us, and the sequel, the war with Midian, which
some have regarded as a blot on the pages of Scripture,
an argument for its inspiration may be drawn.
We find here no ethical anachronisms, no impracticable
ideas of charity and pardon. There is a
sane and strenuous moral aim, not out of keeping with
the state of things in the world of that time, yet
showing the rule and presenting the will of a God who
makes Israel a protesting people. The Hebrews are
men, not angels; men of the old world, not Christians&mdash;true!
Who could have received this history if it
had represented them as Christians, and shown us God
giving them commands fit for the Church of to-day?
They are called to a higher morality than that of Egypt,
for theirs is to be spiritual; higher than that of Chaldea
or of Canaan, for Chaldea is shrouded in superstition,
Canaan in obscene idolatry. They can do something;
and what they can do Jehovah commands them to do.
And He is not an imperfect God because His prophet
does not give from the first a perfect Christian law, a
redeeming gospel. He is the "I Am." Let the whole
course of Old Testament development be traced, and
the sanity and coherency of the theocratic idea as it is
presented in law and prophecy, psalm and parable,
cannot fail to convince any just and frank inquirer.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The end of Balaam's life may be glanced at before
the pages close that refer to his career. In xxxi. 8,
it is stated that in the battle which went against
the Midianites Balaam was slain. We do not know
whether he was so maddened by his disappointment
as to take the sword against Jehovah and Israel, or
whether he only joined the army of Midian in his
capacity of augur. F. W. Robertson imagines "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
insane frenzy with which he would rush into the field,
and finding all go against him, and that lost for which
he had bartered heaven, after having died a thousand
worse than deaths, find death at last upon the spears
of the Israelites." It is of course possible to imagine
that he became the victim of his own insane passion.
But Balaam never had a profound nature, was never
more than within sight of the spiritual world. He
appears as the calculating, ambitious man, who would
reckon his chances to the last, and with coolness, and
what he believed to be sagacity, decide on the next
thing to attempt. But his penetration failed him, as
at a certain point it fails all men of his kind. He
ventured too far, and could not draw back to safety.</p>

<p>The death he died was almost too honourable for this
false prophet, unless, indeed, he fell fleeing like a
coward from the battle. One who had recognised the
power of a higher faith than his countrymen professed,
and saw a nation on the way to the vigour that faith
inspired, who in personal spleen and envy set in
operation a scheme of the very worst sort to ruin
Israel, was not an enemy worth the edge of the sword.
Let us suppose that a Hebrew soldier found him in
flight, and with a passing stroke brought him to the
ground. There is no tragedy in such a death; it is too
ignominious. Whatever Balaam was in his boyhood,
whatever he might have been when the cry escaped
him, "Let me die the death of the righteous," selfish
craft had brought him below the level of the manhood
of the time. Balak with his pathetic faith in cursing
and incantation now seems a prince beside the augur.
For Balaam, though he knew Jehovah after a manner,
had no religion, had only the envy of the religion of
others. He came on the stage with an air that almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
deceived Balak and has deceived many. He leaves it
without one to lament him. Or shall we rather suppose
that even for him, in Pethor beyond the Euphrates, a
wife or child waited and prayed to Sutekh and, when
the tidings of his death were brought, fell into inconsolable
weeping? Over the worst they think and do men
draw the veil to hide it from some eyes. And Balaam,
a poor, mean tool of the basest cravings, may have had
one to believe in him, one to love him. He reminds us
of Absalom in his character and actions&mdash;Absalom, a
man void of religion and morals; and for him the father
he had dethroned and dishonoured wept bitterly in the
chamber over the gate of Mahanaim, "My son Absalom!
would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son,
my son!" So may some woman in Pethor have wailed
for Balaam fallen under the spear of a Hebrew
warrior.</p>

<h2>XXII<br /><br />

<i>A NEW GENERATION</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxvi., xxvii</h4>

<p>The numbering at Sinai before the sojourn in
the Desert of Paran has its counterpart in the
numbering now recorded. In either case those reckoned
are the men able to go forth to war, from twenty years
old and upward. Once, an easy entrance into the land
of promise may have been expected; but that dream
has long passed away. Now the Israelites are made
clearly to understand that the last effort will require
the whole warlike energy they can summon, the best
courage of every one who can handle sword or spear.
There has been hitherto comparatively little fighting.
The Amalekites at an early stage, afterwards the
Amorites and the Bashanites, have had to be attacked.
Now, however, the serious strife is to begin. Peoples
long established in Canaan have to be assailed and
dispossessed. Let the number of capable men be
reckoned that there may be confidence for the
advance.</p>

<p>Nothing is to be won without energy, courage, unity,
wise preparation and adjustment of means to ends.
True, the battle is the Lord's, and He can give victory
to the few over the many, to the feeble over the strong.
But not even in the case of Israel are the ordinary laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
suspended. This people has an advantage in its faith.
That is enough to support the army in the coming
struggle; and the Israelites must make Canaan theirs
by force of arms. For, surely, in a sense, there is right
on the other side, the right of prior possession at least.
The Canaanites, Hittites, Jebusites, Hivites have tilled
the land, planted vineyards, built cities, and fulfilled,
so far, their mission in the world. They, indeed,
never feel themselves secure. Often one tribe falls on
the territory of another, and takes possession. The
right to the soil has to be continually guarded by
military power and courage. It is not wonderful to
Amorites that another race should attempt the conquest
of their land. But it would be strange, humanly
speaking impossible, that a weaker, less capable people
should master those who are presently in occupation.
By the great laws that govern human development,
the dominant laws of God we may call them, this could
not be. Israel must show itself powerful, must prove
the right of might, otherwise it shall not even yet
obtain the inheritance it has long been desiring. The
might of some nations is purely that of animal physique
and dogged determination. Others rise higher in
virtue of their intellectual vigour, splendid discipline,
and ingenious appliances. Man for man, Israelites
should be a match for any people, because there is
trust in Jehovah, and hope in His promise. Now the
trial of battle is to be made; the Hebrews are to realise
that they will need all their strength.</p>

<p>Do we ever imagine that the law of endeavour shall
be relaxed for us, either in the physical or in the
spiritual region? Is it supposed that at some point,
when after struggling through the wilderness we have
but a narrow stream between us and the coveted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
inheritance, the object of our desire shall be bestowed
in harmony with some other law, having been procured
by other efforts than our own? Thinking so, we only
dream. What we gain by our endeavour&mdash;physical,
intellectual, spiritual&mdash;can alone become a real possession.
The future discipline of humanity is misunderstood,
the forecast is altogether wrong, when this is not
comprehended. In this world we have that for which
we labour; nothing more. So-called properties and
domains do not belong to their nominal owners, who
have merely "inherited." The literature of a country
does not belong to those who possess books in which it
is contained; it is the domain of men and women who
have toiled for every ell and inch of ground. And
spiritually, while all is the gift of God, all has to be
won by efforts of the soul. Before humanity lies a
Canaan, a Paradise. But no easy way of acquisition
shall ever be found, no other way indeed than has all
along been followed. The men of God able to go forth
to war need to be numbered and brought under discipline
for the conquests that remain. And what is yet to
be won by moral courage and devotion to the highest
shall have to be kept in like manner.</p>

<p>The second numbering of the people showed that a
new generation filled the ranks. Plagues that swept
away thousands, or the slow, sure election of death,
had taken all who left Egypt excepting a few. It was
the same Israel, yet another. Is, then, the nation of
account, and not the individuals who compose it?
Perhaps the two numberings may be intended to guard
us against this error; at all events, we may take them
so. Man by man, the host was reckoned at Sinai; man
by man it is reckoned again in the plains of Moab.
There were six hundred and three thousand five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
hundred and fifty: there are six hundred and one
thousand seven hundred and thirty. The numberings
by the command of Jehovah could not but mean that
His eye was upon each. And when the new race
looked back along the wilderness way, each group
remembering its own graves over which the sand of
the desert was blown, there might at least be the
thought that God also remembered, and that the
mouldering dust of those who, despite their transgression,
had been brave and loving and honest, was
in His keeping. Israel was experiencing a singular
break in its history. It would begin its new career
in Canaan without memorials, except that cave at
Machpelah where, centuries before, Abraham and Sarah,
Isaac and Jacob, had been buried, and the field at
Shechem where the body of Joseph was laid. No
graves but these would be the monuments of Israel.
In Jehovah, the Ancient of Days, lay the history, with
Him the career of the tribes.</p>

<p>The past receding, the future advancing, and God
the sole abiding link between them. For us, as for
Israel, notwithstanding all our care of the monuments
and gains of the past, that is the one sustaining faith;
and it is adequate, inspiring. The swift decay of life,
the constant flux of humanity, would be our despair if
we had not God.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.<br /></span>

<p>So the "Prayer of Moses the man of God," under the
saddening thought of mortality. But God is "from
everlasting to everlasting," "the dwelling place of His
people in all generations." The life that begins in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Divine will, and enjoys its day under the Divine care,
blends with the current, yet is not absorbed. A
generation or a people lives only as the men and
women that compose it live. Such is the final
judgment, Christ's judgment, by which all providence
is to be interpreted. An Israelite might enter much
into the national hope, and to some extent forget
himself for the sake of it. But his proper life
was never in that forgetfulness: it was always in
personal energy of will and soul that contributed to
the nation's strength and progress. The tribes,
Reuben, Simeon, Judah, and the rest, are mustered.
But the men make the tribes, give them quality, value;
or rather, of the men, those who are brave, faithful,
and true.</p>

<p>That each life is a fact in the Eternal overflowing
Life, conscious of all&mdash;in this there is comfort for us
who are numbered among the millions, with no particular
claim to reminiscence, and aware, at any rate,
that when a few years pass the world will forget us.
In vain the most of us seek a niche in the Valhalla of
the race, or the record of a single line in the history
of our time. Whatever our suffering or achieving,
are we not doomed to oblivion? The grave-yard will
keep our dust, the memorial stone will preserve our
names&mdash;but for how long? Until in the evolutions
that are to come the ploughshare of a covetous age
tears up the soil we imagine to be consecrated for ever.
But there is a memory that does not grow old, in
which for good or evil we are enshrined. "We all
live unto God." The Divine consciousness of us is
our strength and hope. It alone keeps the soul from
despair&mdash;or, if the life has not been in faith, stings
with a desperate reassurance. Does God remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
us with the love He beareth to His own? In any
case each human life is held in an abiding consciousness,
a purpose which is eternal.</p>

<p>The page of Israel's history we are reading preserves
many names. It is in outline a genealogy of the
tribes. Reuben's sons are Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron,
Carmi. The son of Pallu is Eliab. The sons of Eliab
are Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. And of Dathan and
Abiram we are reminded that they strove against
Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah; and the
earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up. The
judgment of evildoers is commemorated. The rest
have their praise in this alone, that they held aloof
from the sin. Turn to other tribes, Zebulun, Asher,
Naphtali, for instance, and in the case of each the
names of those who were heads of families are given.
In the First Book of Chronicles the genealogy is
extended, with various details of settlement and history.
In what are we to find the explanation of this attempt
to preserve the lineage of families, and the ancestral
names? If the progenitors were great men, distinguished
by heroism, or by faith, the pride of the descendants
might have a show of reason. Or again, if the families
had kept the pure Hebrew descent we should be able
to understand. But no greatness is assigned to the
heads of families, not a single mark of achievement or
distinction. And the Israelites did not preserve their
purity of race. In Canaan, as we learn from the Book
of Judges, they "dwelt among the Canaanites, the
Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the
Hivite, and the Jebusite: and they took their daughters
to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to
their sons, and served their gods" (iii. 5, 6).</p>

<p>The sole reason we can find for these records is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
the consciousness of a duty which the Israelites felt,
but did not always perform&mdash;to keep themselves
separate as Jehovah's people. In the more energetic
minds, through all national defection and error, that
consciousness survived. And it served its end. The
Bene-Israel, tracing their descent through the heads of
families and tribes to Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, realised
their distinctness from other races and entered upon
a unique destiny which is not yet fulfilled. It is a
singular testimony to what on the human side appears
as an idea, a sentiment; to what on the Divine side
is a purpose running through the ages. Because of
this human sentiment and this Divine purpose, the
former maintained apparently by the pride of race, by
genealogies, by traditions often singularly unspiritual,
but really by the over-ruling providence of God, Israel
became unique, and filled an extraordinary place among
the nations. Many things co-operated to make her a
people regarding whom it could be said: "Israel never
stood quietly by to see the world badly governed,
under the authority of a God reputed to be just. Her
sages burned with anger over the abuses of the world.
A bad man, dying old, rich, and at ease, kindled their
fury; and the prophets in the ninth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
elevated this idea to the height of a dogma.... The
childhood of the elect is full of signs and prognostics,
which are only recognised afterwards." A race may
treasure its ancient records and venerated names to
little purpose, may preserve them with no other result
than to mark its own degeneracy and failure. Israel
did not. The Unseen King of this people so ordered
their history that greater and still greater names were
added to the rolls of their leaders, heroes, and prophets,
until the Shiloh came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>By the computations that survive, a diminished yet
not greatly diminished number of fighting men was
reckoned in the plains of Moab. Some tribes had
fallen away considerably, others had increased, Simeon
notably among the former, Judah and Manasseh among
the latter. The causes of diminution and increase alike
are purely conjectural. Simeon may have been involved
in the sin of Baal-peor more than the others and
suffered proportionately. Yet we cannot suppose that,
on the whole, character had much to do with numerical
strength. Assuming the transgressions of which the
history informs us and the punishments that followed
them, we must believe that the tribes were on much
the same moral plane. In the natural course of things
there would have been a considerable increase in the
numbers of men. The hardships and judgments of
the desert and the defection of some by the way are
general causes of diminution. We have also seen
reason to believe that a proportion, not perhaps very
great, remained at Kadesh, and did not take the journey
round Edom. It is certainly worthy of notice with
regard to Simeon that the final allocation of territory
gave to this tribe the district in which Kadesh was
situated. The small increase of the tribe of Levi is
another fact shown by the second census; and we
remember that Simeon and Levi were brethren (Gen.
xlix. 5).</p>

<p>The numbering in the plains of Moab is connected
in vv. 52-6 with the division of the land among the
tribes. "To the more thou shalt give the more
inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less
inheritance: to every one according to those that were
numbered of him shall his inheritance be given." The
principle of allocation is obvious and just. No doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
the comparative value of different parts of Canaan
was to be taken into account. There were fertile
plains on the one hand, barren highlands on the other.
These reckoned for, the greater the tribe the larger
was to be the district assigned to it. An elementary
rule; but how has it been set aside! Vast districts of
Great Britain are almost without inhabitants; others
are overcrowded. An even distribution of people over
the land capable of tillage is necessary to the national
health. In no sense can it be maintained that good
comes of concentrating population in immense cities.
But the policy of proprietors is not more at fault than
the ignorant rush of those who desire the comforts and
opportunities of town life.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The twenty-seventh chapter is partly occupied with
the details of a case which raised a question of inheritance.
Five daughters of one Zelophehad of the
tribe of Manasseh appealed to Moses on the ground
that they were the representatives of the household,
having no brother. Were they to have no possession
because they were women? Was the name of their
father to be taken away because he had no son? It was
not to be supposed that the want of male descendants
had been a judgment on their father. He had died in
the wilderness, but not as a rebel against Jehovah, like
those who were in the company of Korah. He had
"died in his own sins." They petitioned for an inheritance
among the brethren of their father.</p>

<p>The claim of these women appears natural if the
right of heirship is acknowledged in any sense, with
this reservation, however, that women might not be able
properly to cultivate the land, and could not do much
in the way of defending it. And these, for the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
were considerations of no small account. The five
sisters may of course have been ready to undertake
all that was necessary as occupiers of a farm, and no
doubt they reckoned on marriage. But the original
qualification that justified heirship of land was ability
to use the resources of the inheritance and take part
in all national duties. The decision in this case marks
the beginning of another conception&mdash;that of the
personal development of women. The claim of the
daughters of Zelophehad was allowed, with the result
that they found themselves called to the cultivation of
mind and life in a manner which would not otherwise
have been open to them. They received by the judgment
here recorded a new position of responsibility as
well as privilege. The law founded on their case must
have helped to make the women of Israel intellectually
and morally vigorous.</p>

<p>The rules of inheritance among an agricultural
people, exposed to hostile incursions, must, like that
of ver. 8, assume the right of sons in preference to
daughters; but under modern social conditions there
are no reasons for any such preference, except indeed
the sentiment of family, and the maintenance of titles
of rank. But the truth is that inheritance, so-called,
is every year becoming of less moral account as compared
with the acquisitions that are made by personal
industry and endeavour. Property is only of value
as it is a means to the enlargement and fortifying of
the individual life. The decision on behalf of the
daughters of Zelophehad was of importance for what
it implied rather than for what it actually gave. It
made possible that dignity and power which we see
illustrated in the career of Deborah, whose position as
a "mother in Israel" does not seem to have depended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
much, if at all, on any accident of inheritance; it was
reached by the strength of her character and the ardour
of her faith.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The generation that came from Egypt has passed
away, and now (xxvii. 12) Moses himself receives his
call. He is to ascend the mountain of Abarim and
look forth over the land Israel is to inhabit; then he
is to be gathered to his people. He is reminded of the
sin by which Aaron and he dishonoured God when
they failed to sanctify Him at the waters of Meribah.
The burden of the Book of Numbers is revealed. The
brooding sadness which lies on the whole narrative is
not cast by human mortality but by moral transgression
and defect. There is judgment for revolt, as of
those who followed Korah. There are men who like
Zelophehad die "in their own sins," filling up the time
allowed to imperfect obedience and faith, the limit of
existence that falls short of the glory of God. And
Moses, whose life is lengthened that his honourable
task may be fully done, must all the more conspicuously
pay the penalty of his high misdemeanour. With the
goal of Israel's great destiny in view the narrative
moves from shadow to shadow. Here and throughout,
this is a characteristic of Old Testament history. And
the shadows deepen as they rest on lives more capable
of noble service, more guilty in their disbelief and
defiance of Jehovah.</p>

<p>The rebuke which darkens over Moses at the close
and lies on his grave does not obscure the greatness
of the man; nor have all the criticisms of the history
in which he plays so great a part overclouded his personality.
The opening of Israel's career may not now
seem so marvellous in a sense as once it seemed, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
so remote from the ordinary course of Providence.
Development is found where previously the complete
law, institution, or system appeared to burst at once
into maturity. But the features of a man look clearly
forth on us from the Pentateuchal narrative; and the
story of the life is so coherent as to compel a belief
in its veracity, which at the same time is demanded
by the circumstances of Israel. A beginning there
must have been, in the line which the earliest prophets
continued, and that beginning in a single mind, a
single will. The Moses of these books of the exodus
is one who could have unfolded the ideas from which
the nationality of Israel sprang: a man of smaller mind
would have made a people of more ordinary frame.
Institutions that grow in the course of centuries may
reflect their perfected form on the story of their origin;
it is, however, certain this cannot be true of a faith.
That does not develop. What it is at its birth it continues
to be; or if a change takes place it will be to
the loss of definiteness and power. Kuenen himself
makes the three universal religions to be Judaism,
Mohammedanism and Christianity. The analogy of
the two latter is conclusive with regard to the first&mdash;that
Moses was the author of Israel's faith in Jehovah.</p>

<p>And this involves much, both with regard to the
human characteristics and the Divine inspiration of the
founder, much that an after-age would have been utterly
incapable of imagining. When we find a life depicted
in these Pentateuchal narratives, corresponding in all
its features with the place that has to be filled, revealing
one who, under the conditions of Israel's nativity,
might have made a way for it into sustaining faith, it
is not difficult to accept the details in their substance.
The records are certainly not Moses' own. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
exoteric, now from the people's point of view, now from
that of the priests. But they present with wonderful
fidelity and power what in the life of the founder went
to stamp his faith on the national mind. And the
marvellous thing is that the shadows as well as the
lights in the biography serve this great end. The
gloom that falls at Meribah and rests on Nebo tells
of the character of Jehovah, bears witness to the
Supreme Royalty which Moses lived and laboured to
exalt. A living God, righteous and faithful, gracious
to them that trusted and served Him, who also visited
iniquity&mdash;such was the Jehovah between whom and
Israel Moses stood as mediator, such the Jehovah by
whose command he was to ascend the height of Abarim
to die.</p>

<p>To die, to be gathered to his people&mdash;and what
then? It is at death we reckon up the account and
estimate the value and power of faith. Has it made
a man ready for his change, ripened his character,
established his work on a foundation as of rock? The
command which at Horeb Moses received long ago,
and the revelation of God he there enjoyed, have had
their opportunity; to what have they come?</p>

<p>The supreme human desire is to know the nature,
to understand the distinctive glory of the Most High.
At the bush Moses had been made aware of the presence
with him of the God of his fathers, the Fear of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. His duty also had been made clear.
But the mystery of being was still unsolved. With
sublime daring, therefore, he pursued the inquiry:
"Behold when I come unto the children of Israel, and
shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent
me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is His
name? what shall I say unto them?" The answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
came in apocalypse, in a form of simple words:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">I
am that I am</span>." The solemn Name expressed an
intensity of life, a depth and power of personal being,
far transcending that of which man is conscious. It
belongs to One who has no beginning, whose life is
apart from time, above the forces of nature, independent
of them. Jehovah says, "I am not what you see, not
what nature is, standing forth into the range of your
sight; I Am in eternal separation, self-existent, with
underived fulness of power and life." The remoteness
and incomprehensibility of God remain, although much
is revealed. Whatever experience of life each man
sums up for himself in saying "I am," aids him in
realising the life of God. Have we aspired? have we
loved? have we undertaken and accomplished? have
we thought deeply? Does any one in saying "I am"
include the consciousness of long and varied life?&mdash;the
"<span class="smcap">I am</span>" of God comprehends all that. And yet He
changes not. Beneath our experience of life which
changes there is this great Living Essence. "<span class="smcap">I am
that I am</span>," profoundly, eternally true, self-consistent,
with whom is no beginning of experience or purpose,
yet controlling, harmonising, yea, originating all in the
unfathomable depths of an eternal Will.</p>

<p>Ideas like these, we must believe, shaped themselves,
if not clearly, at least in dim outline before the mind of
Moses, and made the faith by which he lived. And how
had it proved itself as the stay of endeavour, the
support of a soul under heavy burdens of duty, trial,
and sorrowful consciousness? The reliance it gave
had never failed. In Egypt, before Pharaoh, Moses
had been sustained by it as one who had a sanction for
his demands and actions which no king or priest could
claim. At Sinai it had given spiritual strength and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
definite authority to the law. It was the spirit of
every oracle, the underlying force in every judgment.
Faith in Jehovah, more than natural endowments, made
Moses great. His moral vision was wide and clear
because of it, his power among the people as a prophet
and leader rested upon it. And the fruit of it, which
began to be seen when Israel learned to trust Jehovah
as the one living God and girt itself for His service, has
not even yet been all gathered in. We pass by the
theories of philosophy regarding the unseen to rest in
the revelation of God which embodies Moses' faith.
His inspiration, once for all, carried the world beyond
polytheism to monotheism unchallengeably true, inspiring,
sublime.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that death tested the faith of
Moses as a personal reliance on the Almighty. How
he found sufficient help in the thought of Jehovah when
Aaron died, and when his own call came, we can only
surmise. For him it was a familiar certainty that the
Judge of all the earth did right. His own decision
went with that of Jehovah in every great moral question;
and even when death was involved, however
great a punishment it appeared, however sad a necessity,
he must have said, Good is the will of the Lord. But
there was more than acquiescence. One who had lived
so long with God, finding all the springs and aims of life
in Him, must have known that irresistible power would
carry on what had been begun, would complete to its
highest tower that building of which the foundation had
been laid. Moses had wrought not for self but for God;
he could leave his work in the Divine hand with
absolute assurance that it would be perfected. And as
for his own destiny, his personal life, what shall we
say? Moses had been what he was through the grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
of Him whose name is "<span class="smcap">I am that I am</span>." He could
at least look into the dim region beyond and say, "It
is God's will that I pass through the gate. I am spiritually
His, and am strong in mind for His service. I
have been what He has willed, excepting in my transgression.
I shall be what He wills; and that cannot be
ill for me; that will be best for me." God was gracious
and forgave sin, though He could not suffer it to pass
unjudged. Even in appointing death the Merciful One
could not fail to be merciful to His servant. The
thought of Moses might not carry him into the future of
his own existence, into what should be after he had
breathed his last. But God was His; and he was
God's.</p>

<p>So the personal drama of many acts and scenes
draws to a close with forebodings of the end, and yet
a little respite ere the curtain falls. The music is
solemn as befits the night-fall, yet has a ring of strong
purpose and inexhaustible sufficiency. It is not the
"still sad music of humanity" we hear with the words,
"Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, and behold
the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.
And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered
unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered."
It is the music of the Voice that awakens life, commands
and inspires it, cheers the strong in endeavour and
soothes the tired to rest. He who speaks is not weary
of Moses, nor does He mean Moses to be weary of his
task. But this change lies in the way of God's strong
purpose, and it is assumed that Moses will neither rebel
nor repine. Far away, in an evolution unforeseen by
man, will come the glorification of One who is the Life
indeed; and in His revelation as the Son of the
Eternal Father Moses will share. With Christ he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
speak of the change of death and that faith which
overcomes all change.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The designation of Joshua, who had long been the
minister of Moses, and perhaps for some time administrator
of affairs, is recorded in the close of the chapter.
The prayer of Moses assumes that by direct commission
the fitness of Joshua must be signified to the people.
It might be Jehovah's will that, even yet, another
should take the headship of the tribes. Moses spake
unto the Lord, saying, "Let Jehovah, the God of the
spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation
which may go out before them, and which may come
in before them, and which may lead them out and
which may bring them in; that the congregation of
Jehovah be not as sheep which have no shepherd."
One who has so long endeavoured to lead, and found
it so difficult, whose heart and soul and strength have
been devoted to make Israel Jehovah's people, can
relax his hold of things without dismay only if he is
sure that God will Himself choose and endow the
successor. What aimless wandering there would be
if the new leader proved incompetent, wanting wisdom
or grace! How far about might Israel's way yet be,
in another sense than the compassing of Edom!
Before the Friend of Israel Moses pours out his prayer
for a shepherd fit to lead the flock.</p>

<p>And the oracle confirms the choice to which Providence
has already pointed. Joshua the son of Nun, "a man
in whom is the spirit," is to have the call and receive
the charge. His investiture with official right and
dignity is to be in the sight of Eleazar the priest and
all the congregation. Moses shall put of his own
honour upon Joshua and declare his commission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Joshua shall not have the whole burden of decision
resting upon him, for Jehovah will guide him. Yet
he shall not have direct access to God in the tent of
meeting as Moses had. In the time of special need
Eleazar "shall inquire for him by the judgment of the
Urim before Jehovah." Thus instructed, he shall
exercise high authority.</p>

<p>"A man in whom is the spirit"&mdash;such is the one
outstanding personal qualification. "The God of the
spirits of all flesh" finds in Joshua the sincere will,
the faithful heart. The work that is to be done is not
of a spiritual kind, but grim fighting, control of an army
and of a people not yet amenable to law, under
circumstances that will try a leader's firmness, sagacity,
and courage. Yet, even for such a task, allegiance
to Jehovah and His purpose regarding Israel, the
enthusiasm of faith, high spirit, not experience&mdash;these
are the commendations of the chief. Qualified thus,
Joshua may occasionally make mistakes. His calculations
may not always be perfect, nor the means he
employs exactly fitted to the end. But his faith will
enable him to recover what is momentarily lost; his
courage will not fail. Above all, he will be no opportunist
guided by the turn of events, yielding to pressure
or what may appear necessity. The one principle of
faithfulness to Jehovah will keep him and Israel in a
path which must be followed even if success in a
worldly sense be not immediately found.</p>

<p>The priest who inquires of the Lord by Urim has a
higher place under Joshua's administration than under
that of Moses. The theocracy will henceforth have
a twofold manifestation, less of unity than before. And
here the change is of a kind which may involve the
gravest consequences. The simple statement of ver. 12<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
denotes a very great limitation of Joshua's authority
as leader. It means that though on many occasions
he can both originate and execute, all matters of moment
shall have to be referred to the oracle. There will be
a possibility of conflict between him and the priest
with regard to the occasions that require such a reference
to Jehovah. In addition there may be the uncertainty
of responses through the Urim, as interpreted by the
priest. It is easy also to see that by this method of
appealing to Jehovah the door was opened to abuses
which, if not in Joshua's time, certainly in the time of
the judges, began to arise.</p>

<p>It may appear to some absolutely necessary to refer
the Urim to a far later date. The explanation given
by Ewald, that the inquiry was always by some definite
question, and that the answer was found by means of
the lot, obviates this difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Urim and Thummim,
which mean "clearness and correctness," or as
in our passage the Urim alone, may have been pebbles
of different colours, the one representing an affirmative,
the other a negative reply. But inquiry appears to
have been made by these means after certain rites, and
with forms which the priest alone could use. It is
evident that absolute sincerity on his part, and unswerving
loyalty to Jehovah, were an important element
in the whole administration of affairs. A priest who
became dissatisfied with the leader might easily frustrate
his plans. On the other hand, a leader dissatisfied with
the responses would be tempted to suspect and perhaps
set aside the priest. There can be no doubt that here
a serious possibility of divided counsels entered into
the history of Israel, and we are reminded of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
after events. Yet the circumstances were such that
the whole power could not be committed to one man.
With whatever element of danger, the new order had
to begin.</p>

<p>Moses laid his hands on Joshua and gave him his
charge. As one who knew his own infirmities, he could
warn the new chief of the temptations he would have
to resist, the patience he would have to exercise. It
was not necessary to inform Joshua of the duties of his
office. With these he had become familiar. But the
need for calm and sober judgment required to be
impressed upon him. It was here he was defective,
and here that his "honour" and the maintenance of
his authority would have to be secured. Deuteronomy
mentions only the exhortation Moses gave to be strong
and of a good courage, and the assurance that Jehovah
would go before Joshua, would neither fail him nor
forsake him. But though much is recorded, much also
remains untold. An education of forty years had prepared
Joshua for the hour of his investiture. Yet the
words of the chief he was so soon to lose must have
had no small part in preparing him for the burden and
duty which he was now called by Jehovah to sustain
as leader of Israel.</p>

<h2>XXIII<br /><br />

<i>OFFERINGS AND VOWS</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxviii.-xxx</h4>


<p>The legislation of chapters xxviii.-xxx. appears to
belong to a time of developed ritual and organised
society. Parallel passages in Exodus and
Leviticus treating of the feasts and offerings are by
no means so full in their details, nor do they even
mention some of the sacrifices here made statutory.
The observances of New Moon are enjoined in the
Book of Numbers alone. In chapter xv. they are
simply noticed; here the order is fixed. The purpose
of chapters xxviii., xxix. is especially to prescribe the
number of animals that are to be offered throughout
the year at a central altar, and the quantities of other
oblations which are to accompany them. But the
rotation of feasts is also given in a more connected
way than elsewhere; we have, in fact, a legislative
description of Israel's Sacred Year. Daily, weekly,
monthly, and at the two great festal seasons, Jehovah
is to be acknowledged by the people as the Redeemer
of life, the Giver of wealth and blessedness. Of their
cattle and sheep, and the produce of the land, they are
to bring continual oblations, which are to be their
memorial before Him. By their homage and by their
gladness, by afflicting themselves and by praising God,
they shall realise their calling as His people.</p>

<p>The section regarding vows (ch. xxx.) completes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the legislation on that subject, supplementing Lev.
xxvii. and Numb. vi. It is especially interesting for
the light it throws on the nature of family life, the
position of women and the limitations of their freedom.
The link between the law of offerings and the law of
vows is hard to find; but we can easily understand the
need for rules concerning women's vows. The peace
of families might often be disturbed by lavish promises

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Sacred Year</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxviii.-xxix</h4>

<p>Throughout the year, each day, each sabbath, and
each month is to be consecrated by oblations of varying
value, forming a routine of sacrifice. First the Day,
bringing duty and privilege, is to have its morning
burnt offering of a yearling lamb, by which the Divine
blessing is invoked on the labour and life of the whole
people. A meal offering of flour and oil and a drink
offering of "strong drink"&mdash;that is, not of water or milk,
but wine&mdash;are to accompany the sacrifice. Again in the
evening, as a token of gratitude for the mercies of the
day, similar oblations are to be presented. Of this
offering the note is made: "It is a continual burnt
offering, which was ordained in Sinai for a sweet
savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord."</p>

<p>In these sacrifices the whole of time, measured out by
the alternation of light and darkness, was acknowledged
to be God's; through the priesthood the nation declared
His right to each day, confessed obligation to Him for
the gift of it. The burnt offering implied complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
renunciation of what was represented. No part of the
animal was kept for use, either by the worshipper or
the priest. The smoke ascending to heaven dissipated
the entire substance of the oblation, signifying that the
whole use or enjoyment of it was consecrated to God.
In the way of impressing the idea of obligation to
Jehovah for the gifts of time and life the daily sacrifices
were valuable; yet they were suggestive rather than
sufficient. The Israelites throughout the land knew
that these oblations were made at the altar, and
those who were pious might at the times appointed
offer each his own thanksgivings to God. But the
individual expression of gratitude was left to the
religious sense, and that must often have failed. At a
distance from the sanctuary, where the ascending
smoke could not be seen, men might forget; or again,
knowing that the priests would not forget, they might
imagine their own part to be done when offering was
made for the whole people. The duty was, however,
represented and kept before the minds of all.</p>

<p>In the Psalms and elsewhere we find traces of a
worship which had its source in the daily sacrifice. The
author of Psalm cxli., for example, addresses Jehovah:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Give ear unto my voice when I cry unto Thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Less clearly in the fifth, the fifty-ninth, and the
eighty-eighth psalms, the morning prayer appears to be
connected with the morning sacrifice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Lord, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will keep watch" (Psalm v. 3).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The pious Hebrew might naturally choose the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and the evening as his times of special approach to
the throne of Divine grace, as every believer still feels
it his duty and privilege to begin and close the day
with prayer. The appropriateness of dawn and sunset
might determine both the hour of sacrifice and the
hour of private worship. Yet the ordinance of the
daily oblations set an example to those who would
otherwise have been careless in expressing gratitude.
And earnestly religious persons learned to find more
frequent opportunities. Daniel in Babylon is seen at
the window open towards Jerusalem, kneeling upon his
knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks
to God. The author of Psalm cxix. says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Seven times a day do I praise Thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because of Thy righteous judgments."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The grateful remembrance of God and confession of
His right to the whole of life were thus made a rule
with which no other engagements were allowed to
interfere. It is by facts like these the power of religion
over the Hebrews in their best time is explained.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>We pass now to the Sabbath and the sacrifices by
which it was distinguished. Here the number seven
which recurs so frequently in the statutes of the sacred
year appears for the first time. Connection has been
found between the ordinances of Israel and of Chaldea
in the observance of the seventh day as well as at
many other points. According to Mr. Sayce, the
origin of the Sabbath went back to pre-Semitic days,
and the very name was of Babylonian origin. "In the
cuneiform tablets the <i>sabbatu</i> is described as a 'day of
rest for the soul.'... The Sabbath was also known,
at all events in Accadian times, as a <i>dies nefastus</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
day on which certain work was forbidden to be done;
and an old list of Babylonian festivals and fast-days
tells us that on the seventh, fourteenth, nineteenth,
twenty-first, and twenty-eighth days of each month the
Sabbath rest had to be observed. The king himself, it
is stated, 'must not eat flesh that has been cooked over
the coals or in the smoke, he must not change the
garments of his body, white robes he must not wear,
sacrifices he may not offer, in a chariot he must not
ride.'" The soothsayer was forbidden on that day
"to mutter in a secret place." In this observance of a
seventh day of rest, specially sacred, for the good of
the soul, ancient Accadians and Babylonians prepared
the way for the Sabbath of the Mosaic law.</p>

<p>But while the days of the Chaldean week were
devoted each to a separate divinity, and the seventh
day had its meaning in relation to polytheism, the
whole of time, every day alike, and the Sabbaths with
greater strictness than the others, were, in Israel's law,
consecrated to Jehovah. This difference also deserves
to be noticed, that, while the Chaldean seventh days
were counted from each new moon, in the Hebrew
year there was no such astronomical date for reckoning
them. Throughout the year, as with us, each
seventh day was a day of rest. While we find traces
of old religious custom and observance that mingled
with those of Judaism and cannot but recognise
the highly humane, almost spiritual character those
old institutions often had, the superiority of the religion
of the One Living and True God clearly proves itself
to us. Moses, and those who followed him, felt no
need of rejecting an idea they met with in the ancient
beliefs of Chaldea, for they had the Divine light
and wisdom by which the earthly and evil could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
separated from the kernel of good. And may we not
say that it was well to maintain the continuity of
observance so far as thoughts and customs of the far
past could be woven into the worship of Jehovah's
flock? Neither was Israel nor is any people to pretend
to entire separation from the past. No act of
choice or process of development can effect it. Nor
would the severance, if it were made, be for the good
of men. Beyond the errors and absurdities of human
belief, beyond the perversions of truth due to sin,
there lie historical and constitutional origins. The
Sabbaths, the sacrifices, and the prayers of ancient
Chaldea had their source in demands of God and
needs of the human soul, which not only entered into
Judaism, but survive still, proving themselves inseparable
from our thought and life.</p>

<p>The special oblations to be presented on the Sabbath
were added to those of the other days of the week.
Two lambs of the first year in the morning and two
in the evening were to be offered with their appropriate
meal and drink offerings. It may be noted that in
Ezekiel where the Sabbath ordinances are detailed
the sacrifices are more numerous. After declaring that
the eastern gate of the inner court of the temple,
which is to be shut on the six working days, shall
be opened on the Sabbath and in the day of the new
moon, the prophet goes on to say that the prince, as
representing the people, shall offer unto the Lord in
the Sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram
without blemish. In the legislation of Numbers, however,
the higher consecration of the Sabbath as compared
with the other days of the week did not require
so great a difference as Ezekiel saw it needful to make.
And, indeed, the law of Sabbath observance assumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
in Ezekiel an importance on various grounds which
passes beyond the high distinction given it in the
Pentateuch. Again and again in chapter xx. the
prophet declares that one of the great sins of which
the Israelites were guilty in the wilderness was that of
polluting the Sabbath which God had given to be a
sign between Himself and them. The keeping holy of
the seventh day had become one of the chief safeguards
of religion, and for this reason Ezekiel was moved to
prescribe additional sacrifices for that day.</p>

<p>We find as we go on that the week of seven days,
ended by the recurring day of rest, is an element in the
regulations for all the great feasts. Unleavened bread
was to be eaten for seven days. Seven weeks were
then to be counted to the day of the firstfruits and the
feast of weeks. The feast of tabernacles, again, ran
for seven days and ended on the eighth with a solemn
assembly. The whole ritual was in this way made to
emphasise the division of time based on the fourth
commandment.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The New Moon ritual consecrating the months was
more elaborate. On the day when the new moon was
first seen, or should by computation be seen, besides
the continual burnt offering two young bullocks, one
ram, and seven lambs of the first year, with meal and
drink offerings, were to be presented. These animals
were to be wholly offered by fire. In addition, a sin
offering was to be made, a kid of the goats. Why this
guilt sacrifice was introduced at the new moon service
is not clear. Keil explains that "in consideration of
the sins which had been committed in the course of the
past month, and had remained without expiation," the
sin offering was needed. But this might be said of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
the week in its degree, as well as of the month. It
is certain that the opening of each month was kept
in other ways than the legislation of the Pentateuch
seems to require. In Numbers it is prescribed that
the silver trumpets shall be blown over the new moon
sacrifices for a memorial before God, and this must
have given the observances a festival air. Then we
learn from 1 Sam. xx. that when Saul was king a
family feast was observed in his house on the first day
of the month, and that this day also, in some particular
month, was generally chosen by a family for the yearly
sacrifice to which all were expected to gather (1 Sam.
xx. 5, 6). These facts and the festal opening of Psalm
lxxxi., in which the timbrel, harp, and psaltery, and
joyful singing in praise of God, are associated with the
new moon trumpet, imply that for some reason the
occasion was held to be important. Amos (viii. 5)
implies further that on the day of new moon trade
was suspended; and in the time of Elisha it seems to
have been common for those who wished to consult a
prophet to choose either the Sabbath or the day of new
moon for enquiring of him (2 Kings iv. 23). There can
be little doubt that the day was one of religious activity
and joy, and possibly the offering of the kid for expiation
was intended to counteract the freedom the more
thoughtless might permit themselves.</p>

<p>There are good reasons for believing that in pre-Mosaic
times the day of new moon was celebrated by
the Israelites and all kindred peoples, as it is still
among certain heathen races. Originally a nature
festival, it was consecrated to Jehovah by the legislation
before us, and gradually became of account as the
occasion of domestic gatherings and rejoicings. But
its religious significance lay chiefly in the dedication to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
God of the month that had begun and expiation of
guilt contracted during that which had closed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>We come now to the great annual festivals. These
were arranged in two groups, which may be classed
as vernal and autumnal, the one group belonging to
the first and third months, the other to the seventh.
They divided the year into two portions, the intervals
between them being the time of great heat and the
time of rain and storm. The month Abib, with which
the year began, corresponded generally to our April;
but its opening, depending on the new moon, might be
earlier or later. One of the ceremonies of the festival
season of this month was the presentation, on the
sixteenth day, of the first sheaf of harvest; and seven
weeks afterwards, at Pentecost, cakes made from the
first dough were offered. The explanation of what
may appear to be autumnal offerings in spring is to be
found in the early ripening of corn throughout Palestine.
The cereals were all reaped during the interval
between Passover and Pentecost. The autumnal festival
celebrated the gathering in of the vintage and fruits.</p>

<p>The Passover, the first great feast, a sacrament
rather, is merely mentioned in this portion of Numbers.
It was chiefly a domestic celebration&mdash;not priestly&mdash;and
had a most impressive significance, of which the
eating of the lamb with bitter herbs was the symbol.
The day after it, the "feast of unleavened bread"
began. For a whole week leaven was to be abjured.
On the first day of the feast there was to be a holy
convocation, and no servile work was to be done. The
closing day likewise was to be one of holy convocation.
On each of the seven days the offerings were to be two
young bullocks, one ram, and seven yearling he-lambs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
with their meal and drink offerings, and for sin one
he-goat to make atonement.</p>

<p>The week of this festival, commencing with the
paschal sacrament, was made to bear peculiarly on the
national life, first by the command that all leaven
should be rigidly kept out of the houses. As the
ceremonial law assumed more importance with the
growth of Pharisaism, this cleansing was sought quite
fanatically. Any crumb of common bread was reckoned
an accursed thing which might deprive the observance
of the feast of its good effect. But even in the time
of less scrupulous legalism the effort to extirpate leaven
from the houses had its singular effect on the people.
It was one of the many causes which made Jewish
religion intense. Then the daily sacrificial routine, and
especially the holy convocations of the first and seventh
days, were profoundly solemnising. We may picture
thus the ceremonies and worship of these great days
of the feast. The people, gathered from all parts of the
land, crowded the outer court of the sanctuary. The
priests and Levites stood ready around the altar.
With solemn chanting the animals were brought from
some place behind the temple where they had been
carefully examined so that no blemish might impair the
sacrifice. Then they were slain one by one, and
prepared, the fire on the great altar blazing more and
more brightly in readiness for the holocaust, while the
blood flowed away in a red stream, staining the hands
and garments of those who officiated. First the two
bullocks, then the ram, then the lambs were one after
another placed on the flames, each with incense and
part of the meal offering. The sin offering followed.
Some of the blood of the he-goat was taken by the
priest and sprinkled on the inner altar, on the veil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the Holy of Holies, and on the horns of the great altar,
around which the rest was poured. The fat of the
animal, including certain of the internal parts, was
thrown on the fire; and this portion of the observances
ended with the pouring out of the last drink offering
before the Lord. Then a chorus of praise was lifted
up, the people throwing themselves on the ground and
praying in a low, earnest monotone.</p>

<p>To this followed in the later times singing of chants
and psalms, led by the chorus of Levites, addresses to
the people, and shorter or longer prayers to which
the worshippers responded. The officiating priest,
standing beside the great altar in view of all, now
pronounced the appointed blessing on the people.
But his task was still not complete. He went into the
sanctuary, and, having by his entrance and safe return
from the holy place shown that the sacrifice had been
accepted, he spoke to the assembly a few words of
simple and sublime import. Finally, with repeated
blessing, he gave the dismissal. On one or both of
these occasions the form of benediction used was that
which we have found preserved in the sixth chapter of
this book.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that celebrations like these, into which,
as time went on, the mass of worshippers entered with
increased fervour, gave the feast of unleavened bread
an extraordinary importance in the national life. The
young Hebrew looked forward to it with the keenest
expectancy, and was not disappointed. So long as
faith remained, and especially in crises of the history
of Israel, the earnestness that was developed carried
every soul along. And now that the Israelites bewail
the loss of temple and country, reckoning themselves a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
martyred people, this feast and the more solemn day
of atonement nerve them to endurance and reassure
them of their hope. They are separate still. They
are Jehovah's people still. The covenant remains.
The Messiah will come and bring them new life and
power. So they vehemently cling to the past and
dream of a future that shall never be.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>"The day of the firstfruits" was, according to Lev.
xxiii. 15, the fiftieth day from the morrow after the
passover sabbath. The special harvest offering of this
"feast of weeks" is thus enjoined: "Ye shall bring out
of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth parts
of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be
baken with leaven, for firstfruits unto the Lord" (Lev.
xxiii. 17). According to Leviticus one bullock, two
rams, and seven lambs; according to Numbers two
bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs, were to be
sacrificed as whole offerings; the difference being
apparently that of varying usage at an earlier and later
time. The sin offering of the he-goat followed the
burnt offerings. The day of the feast was one of holy
convocation; and it has peculiar interest for us as the
day on which the pentecostal effusion of the Spirit
came on the gathering of Christians in the upper room
at Jerusalem. The joyous character of this festival
was signified by the use of leaven in the cakes or
loaves that were presented as firstfruits. The people
rejoiced in the blessing of another harvest, the fulfilment
once more by Jehovah of His promise to supply
the needs of His flock. It will be seen that in every
case the sin offering prescribed is a single he-goat.
This particular sacrifice was distinguished from the
whole offerings, the thank offerings, and the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
offerings, which were not limited in number. "It must
stand," says Ewald, "in perfect isolation, as though in
the midst of sad solitude and desolation, with nothing
similar or comparable by its side." Why a he-goat
was invariably ordered for this expiatory sacrifice it
is difficult to say. And the question is not made
more easy by the peculiar rite of the great day of
atonement, when besides the goat of the sin offering for
Jehovah another was devoted to "Azazel." Perhaps
the choice of this animal implied its fitness in some
way to represent transgression, wilfulness, and
rebellion. The he-goat, more wild and rough than
any other of the flock, seemed to belong to the desert
and to the spirit of evil.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>From the festivals of spring we now pass to those
of autumn, the first of which coincided with the New
Moon of the seventh month. This was to be a day
of holy convocation, on which no servile work should
be done, and it was marked by a special blowing
of trumpets over the sacrifices. From other passages
it would appear that the trumpets were used on the
occasion of every new moon; and there must have
been a longer and more elaborate service of festival
music to distinguish the seventh. The offerings prescribed
for it were numerous. Those enjoined for
the opening of the other months were two bullocks,
one ram, seven he-lambs and the he-goat of the sin
offering. To these were now added one bullock, one
ram, and seven he-lambs. Altogether, including the
daily sacrifices which were never omitted, twenty-two
animals were offered; and with each sacrifice, except
the he-goat, fine flour mingled with oil and a drink
offering of wine had to be presented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>There seems no reason to doubt that the seventh
month was opened in this impressive way because of
the great festivals ordained to be held in the course of
it. The labour of the year was practically over, and
more than any other the month was given up to
festivity associated with religion. It was the seventh
or sabbath month, forming the "exalted summit of
the year, for which all preceding festivals prepared
the way, and after which everything quietly came
down to the ordinary course of life." The trumpets
blown in joyful peals over the sacrifices, the offering of
which must have gone on for many hours, inspired the
assembly with gladness, and signified the gratitude and
hope of the nation.</p>

<p>But the joy of the seventh month thus begun did
not go on without interruption. The tenth day was
one of special solemnity and serious thought. It was
the great day of confession, for on it, in the holy
convocation, the people were to "afflict their souls."
The transgressions and failures of the year were to be
acknowledged with sorrow. From the evening of the
ninth day to the evening of the tenth there was to be
a rigid fast&mdash;the one fast which the law ordained.
Before the full gladness of Jehovah's favour can be
realised by Israel all those sins of neglect and forgetfulness
which have been accumulating for twelve months
must be confessed, bewailed, and taken away. There
are those who have become unclean without being
aware of their defilement; those who have unwittingly
broken the Sabbath law; those who have for some
reason been unable to keep the passover, or who have
kept it imperfectly; others again have failed to render
tithes of all the produce of their land according to the
law; and priests and Levites called to a high consecration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
have come short of their duty. With such defects
and sins of error the nation is to charge itself, each
individual acknowledging his own faults. Unless this
is done a shadow must lie on the life of the people;
they cannot enjoy the light of the countenance of God.</p>

<p>For this day the whole offerings are, one young
bullock, one ram, seven he-lambs; and there is this
peculiarity, that, besides a he-goat for a sin offering,
there is to be provided another he-goat, "for atonement."
Maimonides says that the second he-goat is
not that "for Azazel," but the fellow of it, the one on
which the lot had fallen "for Jehovah." Leviticus
again informs us that Aaron was to sacrifice a bullock
as a sin offering for himself and his house. And it was
the blood of this bullock and of the second he-goat
he was to take and sprinkle on the ark and before the
mercy-seat. Further, it is prescribed that the bodies
of these animals are to be carried forth without the
camp and wholly burned&mdash;as if the sin clinging to
them had made them unfit for use in any way.</p>

<p>The great atonement thus made, the reaction of
joy set in. Nothing in Jewish worship exceeded the
solemnity of the fast, and in contrast with that the
gladness of the forgiven multitude. Another crisis was
past, another year of Jehovah's favour had begun.
Those who had been prostrate in sorrow and fear rose
up to sing their hallelujahs. "The deep seriousness
of the Day of Atonement," says Delitzsch, "was transformed
on the evening of the same day into lighthearted
merriment. The observance in the temple
was accomplished in a significant drama which was
fascinating from beginning to end. When the high
priest came forth from the Most Holy Place, after the
performance of his functions there, this was for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
people a consolatory, gladsome sight, for which poetry
can find no adequate words: 'Like the peace-proclaiming
arch in painted clouds; like the morning star, when he
arises from the eastern twilight; like the sun, when
opening his bud, he unfolds in roseate hue.' When
the solemnity was over, the high priest was escorted
with a guard of honour to his dwelling in the city,
where a banquet awaited his more immediate friends."
The young people repaired to the vineyards, the maidens
arrayed in simple white, and the day was closed with
song and dancing.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>This description reminds us of the mingling of
elements in the old Scottish fast-days, closing as they
did with a simple entertainment in the manse.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The feast of tabernacles continued the gladness of
the ransomed people. It began on the fifteenth day
of the seventh month, with a holy convocation and a
holocaust of no fewer than twenty-nine animals, in
addition to the daily sacrifice, and a he-goat for a sin
offering. The number of bullocks, which was thirteen
on this opening day of the feast, was reduced by one
each day till on the seventh day seven bullocks were
sacrificed. But two rams and fourteen he-lambs were
offered each day of the feast, and the he-goat for
expiation, besides the continual burnt offering. The
celebration ended, so far as sacrifices were concerned,
on the eighth day with a special burnt offering of one
bullock, one ram, and seven he-lambs, returning thus
to the number appointed for New Moon.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that on the closing day there was
to be a "solemn assembly." It was "the great day of
the feast" (John vii. 37). The people who during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
week had lived in the booths or arbours which they
had made, now dismantled them and went on pilgrimage
to the sanctuary. The opening of the festival came to
be of a striking kind. "One could see," says Professor
Franz Delitzsch, "even before the dawn of the first
day of the feast, if this was not a Sabbath, a joyous
throng pouring forth from the Jaffa Gate at Jerusalem.
The verdure of the orchards, refreshed with the first
showers of the early rain, is hailed by the people with
shouts of joy as they scatter on either side of the bridge
which crosses the brook fringed with tall poplar-osiers,
some in order with their own hands to pluck branches
for the festal display, others to look at the men who
have been honoured with the commission to fetch from
Kolonia the festal leafy adornment of the altar. They
seek out right long and goodly branches of these
poplar-osiers, and cut them off, and then the reunited
host returns in procession, with exultant shouts and
singing and jesting, to Jerusalem, as far as the Temple
hill, where the great branches of poplar-osier are
received by the priests and set upright around the
sides of the altar, so that they bend over it with their
tips. Priestly trumpet-clang resounded during this
decoration of the altar with foliage, and they went on
that feast day once, on the seventh day seven times,
around the altar with willow branches, or the festive
posy entwined of a palm branch and branches of
myrtles and willows, amidst the usual festive shouts
of Hosanna; exclaiming after the completed encircling,
'Beauty becomes thee, O Altar! Beauty becomes thee,
O Altar!'" So, in later times, the festival began and
was sustained, each worshipper carrying boughs and
fruit of the citron and other trees. But the eighth day
brought all this to a close. The huts were taken down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
the worshippers sought the house of God for prayer
and thanksgiving. The reading of the Law which had
been going on day by day concluded; and the sin
offering fitly ended the season of joy with expiation
of the guilt of the people in their holy things.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The series of sacrifices appointed for days and weeks
and months and years required a large number of
animals and no small liberality. They did not, however,
represent more than a small proportion of the
offerings which were brought to the central sanctuary.
Besides, there were those connected with vows, the
free-will offerings, meal offerings, drink offerings, and
peace offerings (xxix. 39). And taking all together it
will be seen that the pastoral wealth of the people was
largely claimed. The explanation lies partly in this,
that among the Israelites, as among all races, "the
things sacrificed were of the same kind as those the
worshippers desired to obtain from God." The sin
offering, however, had quite a different significance.
In this the sprinkling of the warm blood, representing
the life blood of the worshipper, carried thought into
a range of sacred mystery in which the awful claim
of God on men was darkly realised. Here sacrifice
became a sacrament binding the worshippers by the
most solemn symbol imaginable&mdash;a vital symbol&mdash;to
fidelity in the service of Jehovah. Their faith and
devotion expressed in the sacrifice secured for them
the Divine grace on which their well-being depended,
the blood-bought pardon that redeemed the soul.
Among the Israelites alone was expiation by blood

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Law of Vows</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxx</h4>

<p>The general command regarding vows is that whosoever
binds himself by one, or takes an oath in regard
to any promise, must at all hazards keep his word. A
man is allowed to judge for himself in vowing and
undertaking by oath, but he is to have the consequences
in view, and especially keep in mind that God is his
witness. The matter scarcely admitted of any other
legislation, and neither here nor elsewhere is any
attempt made to lay penalties on those who broke their
vows. To use the Divine Name in an oath which was
afterwards falsified brought a man under the condemnation
of the third commandment, a spiritual doom.
But the authorities could not give it effect. The transgressor
was left to the judgment of God.</p>

<p>With regard to vows and oaths the sophistry of the
Jews and their rabbis led them so far astray that our
Lord had to lay down new rules for the guidance of
His followers. No doubt cases arose in which it was
exceedingly difficult to decide. One might vow with
good intention and find himself utterly unable to keep
his promise, or might find that to keep it would involve
unforeseen injury to others. But apart from circumstances
of this sort there came to be such a net-work
of half-legalised evasions, and so many unseemly discussions,
that the purpose of the law was destroyed.
Absolution from vows was claimed as a prerogative
by some rabbis; against this, others protested. One
would say that if a man vowed by Jerusalem or by the
Law he had said nothing; but if he vowed by what is
written in the Law, his words stood. The "wise men"
declared four kinds of vows not binding&mdash;incentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
vows, as when a buyer vows that he will not give more
than a certain price in order to induce the seller to
take less; meaningless vows; thoughtless and compulsory
vows. In such ways the practice was reduced
to ignominy. It even came to this, that if a man
wished to neutralise all the vows he might make in the
course of a year he had only to say at the beginning of
it, on the eve of the Day of Atonement, "Let every
vow which I shall make be of none effect," and he would
be absolved. This immoral tangle was cut through by
the clear judgment of Christ: "Ye have heard that it
was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear
thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the
heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth,
for it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem,
for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou
swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair
white or black. But let your speech be, Yea, yea;
Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the
evil one." In ordinary conversation and dealings
Christ will have no vows and oaths. Let men promise
and perform, declare and stand to their word. He lifts
even ordinary life to a higher plane.</p>

<p>With regard to women's vows, four cases are made
the subject of enactment. First, there is the case of a
young woman living in her father's house, under his
authority. If she vow unto the Lord, and bind herself
by a bond in the hearing of her father and he do not
forbid, her vow shall stand. It may involve expense
to the father, or put him and the family to inconvenience,
but by silence he has allowed himself to be
bound. On the other hand, if he interpose and forbid
the vow, the daughter is released. The second case is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
that of a woman who at the time of marriage is under
a vow; and this is decided in the same way. Her
betrothed husband's silence, if he hears the promise,
sanctions it; his refusal to allow it gives discharge.
The third instance is that of a widow or a divorced
woman, who must perform all she has solemnly engaged
to do. The last case is that of the married woman
in her husband's house, concerning whom it is decreed:
"Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul,
her husband may establish it, or her husband may
make it void.... If he shall make them null and void
after he hath heard them, then he shall bear her
iniquity."</p>

<p>These regulations establish the headship of the
father and the husband in regard to matters which
belong to religion. And the significance of them lies in
this, that no intrusion of the priest is permitted. If
the "Priests' Code" had been intended to set up a
hierocracy, these vows would have given the opportunity
of introducing priestly influence into family life.
The provisions appear to be designed for the very
purpose of disallowing this. It was seen that in the
ardour of religious zeal women were disposed to make
large promises, dedicating their means, their children,
or perhaps their own lives to special service in connection
with the sanctuary. But the father or husband
was the family head and the judge. No countenance
whatever is given to any official interference.</p>

<p>It would have been well if the wisdom of this law
had ruled the Church, preventing ecclesiastical dominance
in family affairs. The promises, the threats of a
domineering Church have in many cases introduced
discord between daughters and parents, wives and
husbands. The amenability of women to religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
motives has been taken advantage of, always indeed
with a plausible reason,&mdash;the desire to save them from
the world,&mdash;but far too often, really, for political-ecclesiastical
ends, or even from the base motive of
revenge. Ecclesiastics have found the opportunity of
enriching the Church or themselves, or, under cover
of confession, have become aware of secrets that placed
families at their mercy. No practice followed under
the shield of religion and in its name deserves stronger
reprobation. The Church should, by every means in
its power, purify and uphold family life. To undermine
the unity of families by laying obligations on women,
or obtaining promises apart from the knowledge of
those to whom they are bound in the closest relationship,
is an abuse of privilege. And the whole custom of
auricular confession comes under the charge. It may
occasionally or frequently be used with good intention,
and lonely women without trusted advisers among their
kindred may see no other resource in times of peculiar
difficulty and trial. But the submission that forms
part of it is debasing, and the secrecy gives priesthood
a power that should belong to no body of men in
dealing with the souls of their fellow-creatures, and
fellow-sinners. At the very best, confession to a
priest is a weak expedient.</p>

<h2>XXIV<br /><br />

<i>WAR AND SETTLEMENT</i></h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The War with Midian</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxxi</h4>

<p>The command to vex and smite the Midianites
(xxv. 16) has already been considered. Israel
had not the spiritual power which would have justified
any attempt to convert that people. Degrading idolatry
was to be held in abhorrence, and those who clung to it
suppressed. Now the time comes for an exterminating
war. While hordes of Bedawin occupy the hills and
the neighbouring desert, there can be no security either
for morals, property, or life. Balaam is among them
plotting against Israel; and his restless energy, we
may suppose, precipitates the conflict. Moses conveys
the command of God that the attack on Midian shall be
immediately made, and himself directs the campaign.</p>

<p>The details of the enterprise are given somewhat
fully. A thousand fighting men are called from each
tribe. The religious purpose of the war is signified by
the presence in the host of Phinehas, whose zeal has
given him a name among the warriors. He is allowed
to carry with him the "vessels of the sanctuary"; and
the silver trumpets are to be sounded on the march
and in the attack. The Midianitish clan apparently
gives way at once before the Hebrews, and either
makes no stand or is totally defeated in a single battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
All the men are put to the sword, including Balaam
and five chiefs, whose names are preserved. The
women and children are taken; the whole of the cattle
and goods become the prey of the victors; the cities
and encampments are burned with fire. On the return
of the army with the large band of captives, Moses is
greatly displeased. He demands of the officers why
the women have been spared,&mdash;the very women who
caused the children of Israel to trespass against the
Lord. Then he orders all above a certain age, and
the male children, to be put to death. The young girls
alone are to be kept alive.</p>

<p>The purification of those who have been engaged
in the war is next commanded. For seven days the
army must remain outside the camp. Those who have
touched any dead body and all the captives are to be
ceremonially cleansed on the third and seventh days.
Every article of raiment, everything made of skins and
goats' hair, and all woollen articles, are to be purified
by means of the water of expiation. Whatever is made
of metal is to be passed through the fire.</p>

<p>Details of the quantity and division of the prey, and
the voluntary oblations made as an "atonement for
their souls" by the officers and soldiers out of their
booty, occupy the rest of the chapter. The numbers of
oxen, sheep, and asses are great&mdash;six hundred and
seventy-five thousand sheep, seventy-two thousand
beeves, sixty-one thousand asses. No mention is made
of horses or camels. The girls saved alive are thirty-two
thousand. The army takes one half, and those
who remained in the camp receive the other. But of
the soldiers' portion, one in five hundred both of the
persons and of the animals is given to the priests, and
of the people's portion one in fifty to the Levites. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
jewels of gold, ankle-chains, bracelets, signet-rings,
earrings and armlets offered by the men of war as their
"atonement," not one of them having fallen in the
battle, amount in weight to sixteen thousand seven
hundred and fifty shekels, the value of which may be
estimated at some thirty thousand of our pounds. The
gold is brought into the tent of meeting for a memorial
before the Lord.</p>

<p>Now here we have to deal with an accumulation of
statements, every one of which raises some question
or other. The war of national and moral antipathy is
itself easily understood. But the slaughter of so many
in battle and so many others in cold blood, the statement
that not a single Israelite fell, the number and kinds of
the animals captured, the order given by Moses to put
all the women to death, the quantity of gold taken, of
which the offering appears only to have been a part&mdash;all
of these points have been criticised in a more or
less incredulous spirit. In apology it has been said,
with regard to the slaughter of the women, that when
brought as captives by the soldiers they could not be
received into the camp, and there was only this way
of dealing with them, unless indeed they had been sent
back to their ruined encampments, where they would
have slowly died. Again, it has been explained that
the Midianites were so debased and enfeebled as to
have no power to withstand the onset of the Hebrews.
The droves of oxen, sheep, and asses are held to be
not greater than a wealthy nomadic clan, numbering
perhaps two hundred thousand, would be likely to
own; and the quantity of gold is likewise accounted
for by the well-known fact that among Orientals the
wealth represented by precious metals is fashioned into
ornaments for the women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>In detail the difficulties may thus be partly overcome;
yet the whole account remains so singular, both in its
spirit and incidents, that Wellhausen has roundly declared
it to be fictitious, and others have had no resource
but to fall back, even for the slaughter of the women,
on the Divine command. It is true there were other
peoples, the Moabites, for instance, as idolatrous, and
almost as degraded. But a terror of Jehovah's name
had to be created for the moral good of the whole
region, and the Midianites, it is said, who had so grossly
assailed the purity of Israel, were fitly selected for
Divine chastisement. The opinion that the whole
account is an invention of the "Priests' Code" may
be at once dismissed. The ideas of national purity that
prevailed after the exile and are insisted upon in the
books of Ezra and Nehemiah would not have countenanced
the dedication of any spared from the slaughter,
even young girls, as a tribute to Jehovah. The attack
and the issue of it were, no doubt, recorded in the
ancient documents of which the compilers of the Book
of Numbers made use. And the fact must be held to
stand, that there was a grim slaughter relentlessly
carried out at the command of Moses in accordance
with the moral and theocratic ideas that ruled his mind.</p>

<p>But it remains doubtful whether the numbers can
be trusted, even although they appear to be in the
substance of the narrative. The disproportion is
enormous between the twelve thousand Israelites sent
against Midian and the number of men who, if we
accept the figures given, must have fallen without
striking one effective blow for their lives. Of these
there would have been some forty thousand at least.
Assuming that somehow the numbers are exaggerated,
we find the story a good deal cleared. It was entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
in harmony with the spirit of the age that a war <i>à
outrance</i> should have been commanded in the circumstances.
If, then, an adequate force of Hebrews marched
against the Midianites and took them at unawares,
perhaps by night, or when they were engaged in some
idolatrous orgy, their defeat and slaughter would be
comparatively easy. The Hebrews with Phinehas
among them were, we may believe, filled with patriotic
and religious ardour, assured that they were commissioned
to execute Divine justice and must not shrink
from any work that lay in their way, however dreadful.
Does the thing they did still seem incredible? Perhaps
the recollection of what took place after the Indian
Mutiny, when Great Britain was in the same temper,
may throw light upon the question. The soldiers then,
bent on punishing the cruelty and lust of the rebels,
partly in patriotism, partly in revenge, set mercy
altogether aside. If we had the whole history of the
war with Midian, instead of the mere outlines preserved
in Numbers, we might find that, apart from figures,
the statements are by no means over-coloured. Moses
had the entire responsibility of ordering the women
to be put to death. When he saw the train of female
captives, some of them possibly using their arts of blandishment
not without success, he might well be afraid
that the very end for which the war had been undertaken
was to be frustrated. He was a man who did
not scruple to shed blood when the law of God and
the purity of morals and religion seemed to be
endangered. He knew Jehovah to be gracious&mdash;gracious
to those who loved Him and kept His commandments.
But was He not also a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
of the fathers upon the children unto the third and
fourth generations of them that hated Him? It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
this God Moses sought to serve when in the heat of
his indignation, and not without reason, he gave the
terrible order.</p>

<p>The appropriation of some of the captive girls to
the priests and Levites as "Jehovah's tribute," the
offering by the soldiers of part of their booty as an
"atonement" for their souls, the presence of Phinehas
with the "vessels of the sanctuary," and the sacred
trumpets in the ranks&mdash;these manifestly belong to the
time to which the history refers. And it may be said
in closing that circumstances might be well known to
Moses on account of which the attack had to be made
promptly and the dispersion of the Midianites had to
be complete. We cannot tell what Balaam may have
been plotting; but we may be pretty sure there was
nothing too base for him to scheme and the Midianites
to carry into effect. They knew themselves to be
under suspicion, perhaps in danger. With what craft
and vehemence the Bedawin can act we are well aware.
Life even yet is of no account among them. Another
day, perhaps, and the ark might have been carried off
or Moses put to death in his tent. But the nature of
the wrong done to Israel is a sufficient explanation
of the war. And we can also see that the Hebrews
themselves had a lesson in moral severity when their
soldiers went forth to the massacre and returned red
with blood. They learned that the sin of Midian
was abominable in the sight of God and should be
abominable in theirs. They were taught, whether they
received the teaching or not, that they were to be
enemies for ever of those who practised idolatry so
vile. A deep gulf was made between them and all
who sympathised with the worship and customs of the
tribe they destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>And the whole circumstances, remote as they are
from our own time, may bring home even to Christians
the duty of moral decision and relentless war
against the vices and lusts with which too many are
inclined to make terms. We wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against the "wiles of error," the "lusts
of deceit," against "fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions,
divisions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness, revellings
and such like,"&mdash;the works of the flesh. These
Midianites are with us, would draw our hearts away
from religion and destroy our souls. Not only are we
to assail the grosser forms of sin and exterminate them,
but we are with equal severity to strike down the
fair-seeming vices that come with blandishment and
insidious appeal. This is our holy war. The old
form of it required the suppression or extermination of
those identified with vice, men and women, all in whom
the impurity was rooted. Young girls alone could be
spared, whose character might still be shaped by a
higher morality. Even yet, to a certain extent, that
way of dealing with evil has to be followed. We
imprison felons and put murderers to death; but the
new power that has come with Christianity enables
us to deal with many transgressors as capable of
reformation and a new life. And this power is far
as yet from being fully developed.</p>

<p>It is the fault of our age to be on one side too
lenient, on another wanting in patience, charity, and
hope. Excuses are found for sin on the ground that
it is useless to fight against nature, that we must not
be hypocritical nor puritanical. Temptations that come
with mincing gait, cajolery and smiles, are allowed to
disport themselves untouched. Why, it is asked, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
life be made sombre? A stern religion that would
banish gaiety is declared to be no friend of the race.
Under cover of art&mdash;pictorial, dramatic, literary&mdash;the
customs of Midian are not only admitted but allowed
to have authority. And religion even is invoked. Are
not all things pure to the pure? Should not life be
as free and joyous as the Maker clearly intends in
giving us the capacity for those gratifications to which
art of every kind ministers? Is not full freedom indispensable
to the highest religion? Ought not genius,
in every department, to have complete liberty in guiding
and developing the race?</p>

<p>Without hypocrisy, without banishing the sunshine
of life or denying the freedom which is necessary to
progress and vigour, we are to be jealous for morality,
severe against all that threatens it. And here our
age is impatient of direction. The tendency is to a
civilisation without morality, that is, a new barbarism.
The strenuous mind of the old theocratic leaders is
required anew, with a difference. Life and thought
have so far advanced under Christianity that liberty
is good in things which once had to be sternly reprobated;
but only the same guidance will carry us higher.
To those who lead in arts and literature the appeal
has to be made in the name of God and men to regard
the fitness of things. The old ideas of Puritanism are
not to be the standard? True. Neither are the tastes
of Greece nor the manners of Pompeii. Every artist
must, it appears, be his own censor. Let each, then,
use his right under a sense of responsibility to the
God who would have all to be pure and free. There
are pictures exhibited, and poems sent out from the
press, and novels published, which, for all the skill and
charm that are in them, ought to have been cast into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the fire. In private life, too, the Midianitish talk, the
jest, the anecdote, the innuendo, all but indecent, the
hint, the laugh that breaks down the barriers of integrity
and sobriety, show the license of a barbarism which
is bent on conquest. Every Christian is called to wage
against these immoralities an exterminating war.</p>

<p>On the other hand, charity and patience are needed.
It is difficult to forbear with those who seem to find
their pleasure in what is evil, more difficult to continue
the efforts necessary to win them to religion, purity,
and honour. We feel it a hard task to track our own
unholy desires to their retreats and slay them there.
Proteus-like they elude us; when we think they have
been destroyed, a passing word or thought revives
them. And if in the task of our own purification we
need long patience, it is not wonderful that even more
should be required in the attempt to set others free
from their besetting sins. Much of our philanthropy,
again, is useless because we try to cover too large
a field. Few are engaged in comparison with the
enormous region over which effort has to extend, and
we treat the hurt slightly, with too much haste.
Then we grow despondent. Impatience, hopelessness,
should never be known among those who undertake
the Divine work of saving men and women from their
sins. But to cure this, new ideas on the whole subject
of Christian endeavour and new methods of work are
required. The evil forces, a host arrayed against
true life, must be followed into the desert places where
they lurk, and there, with the sword of the Spirit,
which is the bright strong word of God, attacked and
slain. When Christians are brave and loving enough,
when they have patience enough, the gospel of purity
will begin to have its power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Settlement</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxxii</h4>

<p>The request of the men of Reuben and Gad that
they should be allowed to settle on the eastern side
of Jordan in the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead
was at first refused by Moses with warm displeasure.
They appeared to wish exemption from further military
duty, if indeed they had not almost formed the intention
of parting altogether with the rest of the tribes.
Moses asked of them, "Shall your brethren go to
the war and shall ye sit here? And wherefore discourage
ye the heart of the children of Israel from
going over into the land which the Lord hath given
them?" He recalled the spies and the evil report
they brought, by which a former generation had been
disheartened and made to murmur against the Lord.
The forty years of wandering had intervened since
that error&mdash;a long period of suffering and punishment.
And now with this request the men of Reuben and
Gad were playing the same dangerous part. "Behold,
ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of
sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord
toward Israel."</p>

<p>It is somewhat surprising to find the proposal met
in this way. But Moses had doubtless good cause
for his condemnation of the two tribes. For some
time, we can believe, the notion had been entertained,
and already the cattle were driven northwards and
scattered over the pastures of Gilead. The people
felt that the confraternity which had survived the test
of the wilderness journey was now about to break up.
And as the two clans that proposed to settle in Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Palestine were strong and could send a large number
of warriors into the field, there was reason to fear that
the want of them would make the conquest of the great
tribes beyond Jordan too heavy a task.</p>

<p>The circumstances were of a kind resembling those
of a Church when the enjoyment of privilege and of the
gains of the past is chosen by many of its members,
and the rest, discouraged by this moral unbrotherliness,
have to maintain the aggressive work which ought to
be shared by all. The force of unity lost, the Christian
energy of large numbers lying unemployed, the rest
overburdened, Churches often come far short of the
success they might attain. When Reubenites and
Gadites devote themselves to building houses, cultivating
fields, and rearing cattle, neglecting altogether
the command of God to conquer the territory still in
the hands of His enemies, the spirit of religion cannot
but decay. The selfishness of worldly Christians
reacts on those who are not worldly, so that they feel
its subtle influence, even although they scorn to yield.
And when there is some great task to be done which
requires the personal service and contributions of
all, withdrawal of the less zealous may in this way
make victory impossible. True, we have on the other
side the case of Gideon and his rejection of the great
bulk of his army, that he might take the field with
a few who were brave and ready. Numbers of half-hearted
people do not help an enterprise. Still, the
duties of the Church of Christ are so great that all are
required for them. It is no apology to say that men
are apathetic, and therefore useless. They ought to be
eager for the Divine war.</p>

<p>It was not at all wonderful that the men of Reuben
and Gad proposed to settle on the east of Jordan. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
soil of that region, extending from the Jabbok Valley
northwards, and including the whole district watered
by the Yarmuk and its tributaries, was exceedingly
fertile, with fine forests of oak, and stretches of meadow
and arable land. What could be seen of Judæa from
the heights of Moab appeared poor and barren in
comparison with that green and fertile country. There
was abundance of room there, not only for the two
tribes, but for more; and besides the half of Manasseh
which finally joined Reuben and Gad, other clans may
have begun to think that they might rest content without
venturing across Jordan. But Moses had good
reasons for resisting as far as possible this desire.
There was no natural boundary on the east of Gilead
and Bashan. Moab, in a similar situation, was exposed
to the attacks and perhaps corrupted by the influence
of the Midianites. If Israel had taken up its abode in
this region which joined on to the desert, it too would
have become half a desert people. The Jordan came,
as no doubt Moses foresaw, to be the real boundary of
the nation which maintained the faith of Jehovah and
carried on His purposes.</p>

<p>In danger of losing all because they had been too
selfish, the men of Reuben and Gad made a new proposal.
They would go with the rest to the conquest of
Canaan; yea, they would form the van of the army.
If Moses would only allow them to provide sheep-folds
for their flocks and cities for their families, they would
take the field and never think of returning till the other
tribes had all found settlement. The offer was one
which Moses saw fit to accept; but with a caution to
the Reubenites. If they fulfilled the promise, he said,
they should be guiltless before the Lord; but if they
did not, their sin would be written against them. Foreseeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
the result of a division between the east and
west which any such faithless conduct would certainly
cause, he added the warning, "Be sure your sin will
find you out." The time would come when, if they
refused to do their part in helping the rest, they should
find themselves, in some day of extreme peril, without
the sympathy of their brethren, the prey of enemies
who came from the east and north.</p>

<p>Earthly comfort and the means of material prosperity
can never be enjoyed without spiritual disadvantage,
or at least the risk of spiritual loss. The whole region
of ease and wealth lies towards the desert in which the
adversaries of the soul have their lurking-places, from
which they come stealthily or even boldly in open day
to make their assaults. A man who has large means
is exposed to the envy of others; his life may be
embittered by their designs upon him; his nature may
be seriously injured by the flattery of those who have
no power but only the base cunning to which narrow
self-love may descend. These, however, are not the
assailants that are most to be dreaded. Rather
should the man who is rich fear the danger to his
religion and his soul which draws near in other ways.
The wealthy who have no religion court his friendship
and propose to him schemes for increasing his wealth.
Alliances are urged upon him which stir and partly
gratify his ambition. He is pointed to honours that
can only be had through abandoning the great ideas
of life by which he should be ruled. He is served
obsequiously, and is tempted to think that the world
goes very well because he enjoys all he desires, or
is in the way to obtain the fulfilment of his highest
earthly hopes. The curse of egotism hangs over
him, and to escape it he needs a double portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the spirit of humility. Yet how is that to come to
him?</p>

<p>It is well for a man when, before enjoying the good
things of this life in abundance, he has taken the field
with those who have to fight a hard battle, and has
done his share of common work. But even that is not
enough to guard him against pride and self-sufficiency
for the whole term of his existence. Better is it when
by his own choice the hardness is retained in his
experience, when he never discharges himself from the
duty of fighting side by side with others, that he may
help them to their inheritance. That and that alone
will save his life. He is called as a soldier of God to
maintain the holy war for human rights, for the social
well-being and spiritual good of mankind. Every rich
man should be a friend of the people, a reformer, taking
the part of the multitude against his own tendency and
the tendency of his class to exclusiveness and self-indulgence.
The warning given by Moses to Reuben
and Gad in accepting their proposals should linger
with those who are rich and in high station. If they
fail to do their duty to the general mass of their fellow-men,
if they leave the rest to fight, at disadvantage, for
their human inheritance, they sin against God's law,
which calls for brotherhood, and that sin will surely
find them out. In the end no sin is more sure to come
home in judgment. And it is not by some miserable
gifts to religious objects or some patronage of philanthropic
schemes the prosperous can discharge the great
debt laid upon them. In whatever way the inequalities
of life, the disabilities of privilege and wealth, hinder
the realisation of brotherhood, there lie opportunity
and need for men's personal effort. Would this imply
sacrifice of what are called rights, of perhaps no small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
amount of substance? That is precisely the saving
of a rich man's life. To that Christ pointed the rich
young ruler who came to Him seeking salvation&mdash;from
that the inquirer turned away.</p>

<p>And how does the sin of those who neglect such
high duties find them out? Perhaps in the loss of
the possessions they have selfishly guarded, and their
reduction to the level of those whom they kept at
arm's-length and treated as inferiors or as enemies.
Perhaps in the harshness of temper and bitterness of
spirit the proud, friendless rich man may find growing
upon him in old age, the horrible feeling that he has
not one brother where he should have had thousands,
no one to care&mdash;except selfishly&mdash;whether he lives or
dies. To come to that, so far as a man is concerned
with his fellow-men, is to be indeed lost. But these
retributions may be artfully escaped. What then? Is
not One to be reckoned with who is the Guardian of
the human family and gives men power and wealth
only as His stewards, to be used in His service?
The future life does not obliterate society, but it destroys
the class separations, the factitious distinctions,
that exist now. It brings a man face to face with the
fact that he is but a man, like others, responsible to
God. Is not the result indicated by our Lord when
He says to exclusive Pharisaical men, "They shall
come from the east and west, and from the north and
south, and shall sit down in the kingdom&mdash;ye yourselves
cast forth without"? Brotherhood here, not in name,
but in deed and truth, means brotherhood above.
Denial of it here means unfitness for the society of
heaven.</p>

<p>We learn from ver. 19 that the Reubenites and
Gadites confidently affirmed, even when they made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
request to Moses, that their inheritance had fallen to
them on the east side of Jordan. It may be asked
how they knew, since the division was not yet made.
And the answer appears to be that they had made up
their minds on the subject. Without waiting for the
lot, they seem to have said, This is nobody's land now
that the Amorites and Midianites are dispossessed.
We will have it. And there was no sufficient reason
for refusing them their choice when they accepted the
conditions. At the same time, these tribes did not
act fairly and honourably. And the result was that,
although they gained the fat land and the good pastures,
they lost the close fellowship with the other tribes
which was of greater value. Reuben, the premier
tribe, could no longer keep its position. It was by-and-by
succeeded by Judah. Neither Reuben nor Gad
made any great figure in the subsequent history. The
half-tribe of Manasseh, which was settled, not on its
own request, but by authority, in the northern part of
Gilead towards the Argob, had greater distinction.
Gad has some notice. We read of eleven valiant men
of this tribe who swam the Jordan at its highest to join
David in his trouble. "But no person, no incident is
recorded to place Reuben before us in any distincter
form than as a member of the community (if community
it can be called) of the Reubenites, the Gadites,
and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The very towns of
his inheritance&mdash;Heshbon, Aroer, Kiriathaim, Dibon,
Baal-meon, Sibmah, Jazer&mdash;are familiar to us as Moabite,
not as Israelite, towns." The Reubenites, in fact, under
the influence of their wild neighbours, gradually lost
touch with their brethren and fell away from the religion
of Jehovah.</p>

<p>It is a parable of the degeneration of life.&mdash;Earthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
choice rules and heavenly faith is hazarded for the sake
of a temporal advantage. Men have their will because
they insist upon it. They do not consult the prophet,
but make terms with him, that they may gain their end.
But as they place themselves, so they have to live, not
on the soil of the promised land, no integral part of
Israel.</p>

<h2>XXV<br /><br />

<i>THE WAY AND THE LOT</i></h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Numbers</span> xxxiii., xxxiv</h4>

<p>1. The itinerary of xxxiii. 1-49 is one of the
passages definitely ascribed to Moses. It
opens with the departure from Rameses in Egypt on
the morrow after the passover, when the children of
Israel "went out with an high hand in the sight of all
the Egyptians." The exodus is made singularly impressive
in this narrative by the addition that it took
place "while the Egyptians were burying all their
firstborn, which the Lord had smitten among them."
The Divine salvation of Israel begins when the dark
shadow of loss and judgment rests on their oppressors.
The gods of Egypt are discredited by the triumph of
Jehovah's people. They can neither save their own
worshippers nor prevent the servants of another from
obtaining liberty.</p>

<p>From Rameses, the place of departure, to Abel-shittim,
in the plains of Moab, forty-two stations in all
are given at which the Israelites pitched. Of these
about twenty-four are named either in Exodus, in other
parts of the Book of Numbers, or in Deuteronomy.
Some eighteen, therefore, are mentioned in this passage
and nowhere else. Of the whole number, comparatively
few have as yet been identified. The Egyptian localities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
at least Rameses and Succoth, are known.
With the exit from Egypt, at the crossing of the
Red Sea difficulty begins. Our passage says that the
Israelites went three days' journey into the wilderness
of Etham; Exodus calls it the wilderness of Shur.
Then Marah and Elim bring the travellers, according
to chap. xxxiii., to the Red Sea, the <i>Yâm Suph</i>.
Ordinarily, this is supposed to be the Gulf of Suez,
alongside which the route would have lain from the
day it was crossed. There are, however, the best
reasons for believing that this "Red Sea" is the eastern
gulf, The Elanitic, as it must be in xiv. 25, where, after
the evil report of the spies, the Divine command is
given: "To-morrow turn ye, and get you into the
wilderness by the way to the Red Sea." From this
identification of the Yâm Suph many things follow.
And one is the rejection of the ordinary opinion regarding
the position of Sinai. The mountain of the law-giving
is always described as situated in Midian. Now,
Midian is beyond Elath, on the eastern side of the
Yâm Suph, not in the peninsula between the Gulfs of
Suez and Akabah. Elim and Elath, or Eloth, appear
to be names for the same place, at the head of the
Gulf of Akabah. We have therefore to look for
Sinai either among the southern hills of Seir or those
lying more southward still, towards the desert. In
Deborah's song (Judg. v. 4, 5) occur the following
verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lord, when Thou wentest out of Seir,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When Thou marchedst out of the field of Edom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yea, the clouds dropped water;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The mountains flowed down at the presence of the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Even yon Sinai at the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>
<p>In the same direction the "Prayer of Habbakuk"
points (iii. 3, 7):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God came from Teman,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the Holy One from Mount Paran.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His glory covered the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the earth was full of His light....<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tradition which places Sinai in the south of the
peninsula between the two gulfs "is of later origin
than the lifetime of St. Paul, and can claim no higher
authority than the interested fancies of ignorant c&#339;nobites.
It throws into confusion both the geography
and the history of the Pentateuch, and contradicts the
definite statements of the Old Testament." So the
most recent inquiry.</p>

<p>If Mount Sinai was somewhere to the south of Edom,
the journey thence to Kadesh by way of Kibroth-hattaavah
and Hazeroth, localities mentioned both in
Numb. xi. and xxxiii., may have had other stations;
and these may be named in ver. 19 of our passage
and onward. But identification of the places is exceedingly
doubtful till we come to Ezion-geber, in the
Arabah, and Mount Hor. Deut. x. places the scene
of Aaron's death at Mosera, which seems to be the
same as Moseroth, and is there given along with other
stations named in the itinerary&mdash;-Bene-jaakan, Gudgodah
(= Hor-haggidgad), Jotbathah. And this seems to
prove that these localities were in or near the Arabah,
Moseroth being in the region of Mount Hor. But
where Kadesh is to be found between Rithmah and
Moseroth, and under what name, it is impossible to
say. Keil argues for Rithmah itself. Palmer reckons
twenty stations to the first arrival at Kadesh. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
map, however, shows a Mount Sheraif, which may be
the same as Shepher, not far from Gadis, which he
identifies with Kadesh. For the rest we are left in
great ignorance, relieved only by this, that at the most
there are but eighteen stations given, more probably
thirteen, for the whole thirty-seven years between the
first arrival at Kadesh and the death of Aaron at
Mount Hor; and five or six of these were on the
Arabah. During the whole of that long period there
were only a few removals of the tabernacle, and those
apparently within a limited area near Kadesh.</p>

<p>A list of names with only three historical notes
appears a singular memorial of the forty years. Time
was, no doubt, when the places named were all well
known, and any Israelite desiring to satisfy himself as
to the route by which his forefathers went could make
it out by help of this passage. To us the interest of
the subject is partly the same as that which might have
been found by a Hebrew, say, of the time of Hezekiah,
for whom the verification of the wilderness journey
might be a help to faith. But the impossibility of
identifying the localities shows that there are matters
in the history of Israel which are of no particular
importance now. There is more danger in seeking to
gratify mere curiosity, than profit in any possible
discoveries. Why should not the mountain of the
law-giving be hid in the shadows as well as the grave
in which Moses was laid? Why should not the places
at which Israel encamped be to us mere names, since,
if we could identify them, it might only be to add fresh
difficulties instead of clearing away those that exist?
The Israelites who entered Canaan had not seen all
the way by which Jehovah led His people. When
they crossed the Jordan, present duty was to engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
them, not the mere names that belonged to the past.
They were to forget the things behind, and stretch
forward to the things which were before. And duty
is the same still. Our backward glance, especially on
the actual path from one spot of earth to another by
which men have gone in trial and anticipation, must
not hinder the efforts called for by the circumstances
of our own time. The way of the desert, especially,
may well lie half obliterated in the distance, since we
know the spiritual fruit of the dealings of God with Israel,
and can bear it with us as we follow our own road.</p>

<p>The ideas of change and urgency are in our passage.
The wilderness journey was taken by a people on
whom Divine influences had laid hold, who of themselves
would have remained content in Egypt, but were
not suffered, because God had some greater thing in
store for them. The urgency throughout was His.
And so is that which we ourselves feel hurrying us
from change to change, from place to place. We may
not be in the wilderness, but in a spot of shelter and
comfort; and it may be no house of bondage, but a
vantage-ground for generous effort. Even when we
are thus happily settled, as we imagine, the call comes,
and we must strike our tents. At other times our own
anxiety anticipates the command. But we know that
always, whether we pass into sterner conditions of life or
escape to more pleasant circumstances, the times and
changes that happen to us are of God's appointing, that
His providence urges us toward a goal. And this
means that our reaching the goal must be by His way,
although properly we endeavour to find it for ourselves.</p>

<p>The number of the stations at which Israel encamped
in the course of forty years can scarcely be taken as
representing the number of changes from dwelling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
dwelling any pilgrim through this world shall have
to make. But if we think of halting-places and movements
of thought, we shall have a fruitful parallel. From
the twentieth to the sixtieth year&mdash;may we not say?&mdash;is
the time of journeying that takes the mind from its
first freedom to comparative rest. Not far on the
Divine law-giving impresses itself on the conscience;
and hence a direct road may appear to lead into the
peace of obedience. But the stations successively
reached, Kibroth-hattaavah, Hazeroth, Rithmah, and
the rest, represent each a peculiar difficulty encountered,
a barrier to our steady progress towards the settled
mind. St. Paul indicates one he found when he
says: "I had not known coveting, except the law
had said, Thou shalt not covet." Another halt is
imposed when it is found that the law appears to
forbid what is according to nature; still another when
obedience requires separation from those who have
been valued friends and pleasant companions. These
hindrances left behind as the soul, still confiding and
hopeful, is urged on towards the goal, a great trial like
that of Kadesh follows. We are not far from the
frontier of promise; and anticipations are formed of
many delights for heart and life. Is not obedience to
bring felicity, an easy salvation from doubt and fear?
But it becomes plain that there are enemies to faith
and peace beyond the border as well as in the region
already crossed. Complete conformity to the Divine
will has not been achieved. Will it ever be achieved?
We begin to doubt the result of law-keeping. There
is perhaps a backward look to Sinai, implying a question
whether God spoke there, or beyond Sinai, to the old
traditional way of life. And so another term of difficult
inquiry begins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way many find themselves held for a long
period of middle life. Their minds move from one
point to another without seeming to make any progress.
But neither does rest come. It is seen that partial
obedience, a measure of nearness to the perfection
once dreamed of, will not suffice. Then arises the
question whether obedience can ever save. There is
return almost to Sinai itself, at least to a place from
which its peak is seen and the mind is confirmed as
to the inexorability of law. So the urgency of the
Divine will is felt, and the way is fixed. If the soul
would make its own way into peace, it is driven
back. For, perhaps, it would have the difficulty
solved by taking the way of a Church, accepting a
creed&mdash;as Israel would have passed through the
territory of Edom. This also is forbidden. Trusted
helpers fall by the way, as Aaron died at Hor, and
there is sorrowful delay. But movement is enforced;
and, finally, it is by a road that reveals Sinai and the
law in quite another aspect, showing vital faith, not
mere obedience, to be the means of salvation, our
progress is made. Round the borders of Edom, not
by trust in creed or Church, but by confidence in God
Himself, the soul must advance. Then strength comes.
Point after point is reached and passed. Self-righteousness,
pride, and Pharisaism&mdash;Amorites of
the mountain land&mdash;are overcome. At length through
the faith of Christ peace is found, the peace that is
possible on this side the river.</p>

<p>It is our high privilege to be urged and led on thus
by Him who knows the way we should take, who tries
us that we may come forth purified as gold. Without
Divine pressure we should content ourselves in the
desert and never see the real good of life. So many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
lose themselves because they will not admit that to be
of the truth is necessary to salvation. There is a way
of thinking, or rather refusing to think, of spiritual
verities which keeps the soul unaware of the purpose
God would carry into effect, or indifferent to it. The
mind refuses its duty; and in the midway of life the
spiritual goal fades from view. To guard against this
taking place in the case of any one is the office of the
Gospel ministry. If evangelical preaching does not
keep thought awake and attentive to Divine inspirations,
if it does not speak to those who are in every
stage of perplexity, at every possible camping-ground,
it fails of its high purpose.</p>


<p>2. Commandment is given that when the Israelites
pass over Jordan they shall use effectual means for
establishing themselves as the people of Jehovah in
Canaan. They are, for one thing, to drive out before
them all the inhabitants of the land. Nothing is here
said of putting them all to the sword; only they are
not to be left even in partial occupation. The plan of
Israel's settlement in its new territory requires that it
shall be subject to no alien influence, and shall have the
field entirely to itself for the development of customs,
civilisation, and religion. And in this there is nothing
either impossible or, as the ideas of the time went,
strange and cruel. We do not need to take refuge in the
command of God and defend it by saying that He had
absolute right over the lives of the Canaanites. The
tides of war and population were continually flowing
and receding. When the Israelites reached Canaan,
they had the same right as others to occupy it, provided
they could make their right good at the point of the
sword. Yet for their own special consciousness the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
command given by Moses in Jehovah's name was most
important. It was only as His people they were to
advance, and as His people they were to dwell separate
in Canaan.</p>

<p>To drive out all the inhabitants of the land was,
however, a difficult task; and even Moses might not
intend the order to be literally obeyed. We have seen
that he did not require the destruction of the Midianites
to be absolute. In the wars of conquest in Canaan
cases of a similar kind would necessarily arise. When
a tribe was driven out of its cities many would be left
behind, some of whom would conceal themselves and
gradually venture from their hiding-places. The command
was general, and could scarcely be supposed to
require the putting to death of all children. And again,
as we know, there were fortresses which for a long
time defied attempts to reduce them. The Israelites
were not so faithful to God that Moses could expect
their success to be insured by supernatural aid. It is
the constant purpose they are to have in view, to sweep
the land clear of those presently in occupation. As
they establish themselves, this will be carried out; and
if they fail, allowing any of the tribes to remain, these
will be as pricks in their eyes and as thorns in their
sides.</p>

<p>The will of God that Israel, called to special duty in
the world, was to keep itself separate, is here strongly
emphasised. It was the only way by which faith could
be preserved and made fruitful. For the Canaanites,
already civilised and in many of the arts superior to
the Hebrews, had gross polytheistic beliefs imbedded
in their customs, and a somewhat elaborate cultus which
was observed throughout the whole land. "Figured
stones," which by their shape or incised emblems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
conveyed religious ideas; molten images, probably of
bronze, like those found at Tel el Hesy, which were for
household use, or of a larger size for tribal adoration;
"high places" crowned by altars and sacrificial stones,
were specially to be destroyed. The tendency to polytheism
required to be carefully guarded against, for the
gods of Canaan represented the powers of nature, and
their rites celebrated the fruitfulness of earth under
the lordship of Baal or Bel, and the mysterious processes
of life associated with the influence of Astarte, the moon.
The divinities of Egypt also appear to have had their
worshippers; and, indeed, the mixed population of the
land had drawn from every neighbouring region symbols,
rites, and practices supposed to propitiate the unseen
powers on whose favour human life must depend.
Israel could prosper only by rejecting and extirpating
this idolatry. Allowed to survive in any degree, it
would be the cause of physical suffering and spiritual
decay.</p>

<p>The command thus ascribed to Moses was again
one which he must have known the Israelites would
find difficult to carry out, even if they were cordially
disposed to obey it. The sacred places of a country
like Canaan tend to retain their reputation even when
the rites fall into disuse; and however expeditiously
the work of sweeping away the original inhabitants
might be done, there was no small danger that
knowledge of the cult as well as veneration for the
high places would be learned by the Hebrews. The
command was made clear and uncompromising so that
every Israelite might know his duty; but the difficulty
and the peril remained. And as we know from the
Book of Judges and subsequent history, the law,
especially in regard to the demolition of high places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
became practically a dead letter. Jehovah was worshipped
at the ancient places of sacrifice; and so far
were even pious Israelites of the next few centuries
from thinking they did wrong in using those old altars,
that Samuel fell in with the custom. It was true in
regard to this commandment as it is with regard to
many others,&mdash;the high mark of duty is presented, but
few aim at it. Expediency rules, the possible is made
to suffice instead of the ideal. There is reason to
believe, not only that the images and stone symbols of
Canaan were venerated, but that Jehovah Himself was
worshipped by many of the Hebrews under the form of
some animal. And the Canaanites became to those who
fraternised with them as pricks in their eyes. Spiritual
vision failed; faith fell back on the coarse emblems
used by the old inhabitants of the land. Then the
vigour of the tribes decayed and they were judged and
punished.</p>


<p>3. The boundaries of the land in which the Israelites
were to dwell are laid down in ch. xxxiv.; but, as
elsewhere, there is difficulty in following the geography
and identifying the old names. The south quarter is
to be "from the wilderness of Zin along by the side
of Edom"&mdash;that is to say, it is to include the region
of Zin near Kadesh and extend to the mountains of
Seir. The "ascent of Akrabbim" is apparently the
Ghor rising southwards from the Dead Sea. The line
then runs along the Arabah for some distance, say fifty
miles, across by the south of the Azazimeh hills and
of Kadesh Barnea towards the stream called the river
or brook of Egypt, which it followed to its debouchment
in the Mediterranean. The western boundary was the
Mediterranean or Great Sea for a distance of perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
one hundred and sixty miles. The northern boundary
is exceedingly obscure. They were to keep in view a
"mount Hor" as a landmark; but no two geographers
can be said to agree where it was. The "entering in
of Hamath" is also a locality greatly disputed. Most
likely it was some well-known part of the road leading
along the Leontes valley to that of the Orontes. If we
take the mount Hor here indicated to be Hermon,
a line running west and striking the Mediterranean
somewhere north of Tyre would be a natural boundary,
and would correspond fairly with the actual partition
and occupation of the country. It is certain, however,
that both the Philistines and Ph&#339;nicians, especially the
latter, were so strongly established in the southern
and northern parts of the seaboard that any attempt
to dispossess them was soon discovered to be futile.
And even in the limited central range from Kedesh
Naphtali to Beersheba the settlement was only effected
gradually.</p>

<p>The Canaan of the Divine promise marked out, yet
never fully possessed, is a symbol of the region
of this life which those who believe in God have
assigned to them, but never entirely enjoy. There are
boundaries within which there is abundant room for
the development of the life of faith. It is not, as the
world reckons, a district of great resources. As Canaan
had neither gold nor silver, neither coal nor iron mines,
as its seaboard was not well supplied with harbours,
nor its rivers and lakes of great use for inland navigation,
so we may say the life open to the Christian
has its limitations and disabilities. It does not invite
those who seek pleasure, wealth, or dazzling exploits.
Within it, discipline is to be found rather than enjoyment
of earthly good. The "milk and honey" of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
land are spiritual symbols, Divine sacraments. There
is room for the development of life in every branch of
study and culture, but in subordination to the glory
of God, and for the testimony that should be borne to
His majesty and truth.</p>

<p>Many of us affect to despise so narrow a range of
thought and endeavour, and persist in believing that
something more than discipline may be looked for in
this world. Is there not a proper kingdom of humanity
better than any kingdom of God? May not the race
of men, apart from any service paid to an Unseen
God, attain dignity of its own, power, gladness, magnificence?
It is supposed that by rejecting all the
limitations of religion and refusing the outlook to
another life the united labour of men will make this
life free and this earth a paradise. But it remains
true that men must limit their hopes with regard to
their own future here as individuals and the future of
the race. We must accept the boundaries God has
fixed, on one side the swift Jordan, on the other
the Great Sea. There are seemingly rich fields beyond,
wide regions that invite the tastes and senses, but
these are no part of the soul's inheritance; to explore
and reduce them would bring no real gain.</p>

<p>The range that lies open to us as servants of God,
and affords ample space for the discipline of life, is
often not used and therefore not enjoyed. When
people will not accept the inevitable fixed limits within
which their time and vigour can be occupied to the
best advantage, when they look covetously to districts
of experience not meant for them, as Israel did at certain
periods of her history, their life is spoiled. Discontent
begins, envy follows. Where in seeking and reaching
moral gains, purity, courage, love, there would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
been a continual sense of adequate result and encouraging
prospect, there is now no gain, no pleasure.
The appointed lot is despised, and all it can yield held
in contempt. How many there are who, with a full
river of Divine bounty on one side their life, and the
great ocean of the Divine faithfulness ebbing and flowing
on the other, with the pastures and olive-groves
of the Word of God to nourish their soul, with access
to His city and sanctuary, and an outlook from summits
like Tabor and Hermon to a transfigured life in the
new heavens and earth, speak nevertheless with scorn
and bitterness of their heritage! They might be
reaching "the measure of the stature of the fulness
of Christ," but they remain graceless and discontented
to the end. Israel, understanding its destiny and
using its opportunities aright, might well say&mdash;and so
may every one who knows the truth as it is in Jesus
Christ&mdash;"the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;
yea, I have a goodly heritage." But this gladness of
heart has its root in believing content. The restricted
land is full of God's promise: "Thou maintainest my
lot." The security of Jehovah's word encompasses
the man of faith.</p>

relating to the Levitical cities may be said
to describe an ideal settlement. We have, at all events,
no evidence that the command was ever fully carried
out. It was to the effect that in forty-eight cities,
scattered throughout the whole of the tribes in proportion
to their population, dwellings were to be allotted
to the Levites, who were also to have the suburbs
of those cities; that is to say, the fields lying immediately
about them, "for their cattle, and for their
substance, and for all their beasts." It is assumed
that closely surrounding each of the cities there shall
be pasturage, and that a regular or fairly regular
boundary can be made at the distance of one thousand
cubits from the city. Singularly, nothing whatever
is said as to the duties of the Levites thus distributed
throughout the land on both sides Jordan, from Kedesh
Naphtali in the north, to Debir in the south, according
to Josh. xxi. It is not said that they were to perform
any ecclesiastical functions or instruct the people in
the Divine Law. Yet something of the kind must
have been intended, since many of them were at a
great and inconvenient distance from Shiloh and other
places at which the ark was stationed.</p>

<p>According to this statute, there is, for one thing, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
be no seclusion of the Levites from the rest of the
people. If clergy and laity, as we say, are distinguished,
the distinction is made as small as possible.
From the terms of the present order (xxxv. 2, ff.)
it might appear that the towns given to the Levites
were to be occupied by them exclusively. In parallel
passages, however, it is clear that the Levites dwelt
along with others in the cities; and in this way, as
well as by engaging in pastoral work, they were kept
closely in touch with the men of the tribes. The
land allotted to them was not sufficient for farms; but
the tithes and offerings were to a large extent for their
support. And the arrangement thus sketched is held
with some reason to be an ideal for every order of men
called to similar duty. The Levites, indeed, were not
at first spiritual. Neither the nature of their work at
the sanctuary, nor the conditions of their life, implied
any special consecration of heart. But the general
tone of a religious ministry advances; and even in
David's time there were Levites who served God in no
mere routine, but with earnest mind, with a measure of
inspiration. The ordinance here is in behalf of a
consecrated order devoted to the service of God.</p>

<p>The suburbs, or pasture lands about the cities, are
measured a thousand cubits broad, and are to be two
thousand cubits along each of the four boundaries. If the
figures given are correct it would seem that, although
the wall of the city is spoken of, the measurement must
really have begun in the centre of the city; otherwise
there could never have been a square of land, cities not
taking that form; nor could a boundary of two thousand
cubits on each aspect, north, south, east, and west, be
made out. The cities must often have been small, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
cluster of poor huts built of clay or rude brick, with a
wall of similar material. We need imagine no stately
dwellings or fine pleasure grounds when we read here
of the provision for the Levites. Within the wall they
had their bare, mean cottages; outside, there might
be a breadth of perhaps four hundred yards of poor
enough ground which they could claim. But as the
tithes were not always paid, so the dwellings and the
pasturage may not always have been allotted. There
is not much reason to wonder that in a short time after
the settlement in Canaan the Levites, finding no special
work at the sanctuary, and obtaining little support from
the offerings, gradually became part of the tribes in
which they happened to have their abode. Hence we
read in Judges (xvii. 7) of "a young man out of Bethlehem-judah,
of the family of Judah, who was a Levite."</p>

<p>The main purpose of the present statute, so far as it
refers to the dwellings of the Levites, would appear to
have been economic, not religious. It was that all the
tribes might have their share of maintaining the servants
of the sanctuary. But it seems likely that a class half
priestly would, in lack of other duty, attach itself to the
high places, and set up a worship not contemplated by
the law. And if this is to be regarded as a misfortune,
the choice of the Levitical cities is in some cases
difficult to account for. Kedesh in Naphtali had been
a famous holy place of the Canaanites; so probably
were others, as Gibeon, Shechem, Gath-rimmon. The
special symbol of Jehovah was the ark; and where the
ark was the principal national rites were always performed.
But in a time of pioneer work and constant
alarms the central sanctuary could not always be
visited, and the Levites appear to have lent themselves
to worship of a local kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>An ecclesiastical order needs great faithfulness if it
is not to become irreligious through poverty, or proud
and domineering through assumption of power with
God. To live poorly as those Levites were expected
to live, without the opportunity of earthly gain, while
often the share of national support which was due fell
to a very low and wholly inadequate amount, would
try the fidelity of the best of them. No large claim
need be made in behalf of men specially engaged in the
work of the Christian Church; and great wealth seems
inappropriate to those who represent Christ. But
what is their due should at least be paid cheerfully,
and the more so if they give earnest minds to the
service of God and man. With all faults that have
at various periods of the Church's history stained the
character of the clergy, they have maintained a testimony
on behalf of the higher life, and the sacredness of duty
to God. A materialistic age will make light of that
service, and point to ecclesiastical pride and covetousness
as more than counterbalancing any good that is done.
But a broad and fair survey of the course of events
will show that the witness-bearing of a special class
to religious ideas has kept alive that reverence on
which morality depends. True, the ideal of a theocracy
would dispense with an order set apart to
teach the law of God and to enforce His claims on
men. But for the times that now are, even in the
most Christian country, the witness-bearing of a
gospel ministry is absolutely needful. And we may
take the statute before us as anticipating a general
necessity, that necessity which the apostles of our
Lord met when they ordained presbyters in every
Church, and gave them commission to feed the flock
of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>


<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Cities of Refuge.</span> Among the forty-eight
cities that provide dwellings for the Levites, six are
to be cities of refuge, "that the man-slayer which
killeth any person unwittingly may flee thither." Three
of these cities are to be on the east and three on the
west side of Jordan. According to other enactments they
are to be distributed so as to be reached quite easily
from all parts of the country. They were sanctuaries
for any one fleeing from the "avenger of blood"; but
the protection found in them was not by any means
absolute. Only if there appeared to be good cause for
admitting a fugitive was he afforded refuge even for
a time, and his trial followed as soon as possible.
The laws of protection and judgment are here laid
down not fully, though with some detail.</p>

<p>We notice first that the statutes regarding the man-slayer
are frankly based on the primitive practice of
blood revenge. It was the duty of the nearest male
relation of one who had been slain to seek the blood
of the man who slew him. The duty was held to be
one which he owed to his brother, to the community,
and to God; and the principle of retribution in such
cases was embodied in the saying, "Whoso sheddeth
man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." The
goël, or redeemer, whose part it was to recover for a
family land that had been alienated, or a member of
the family who had fallen into slavery, had it also laid
on him to seek justice on behalf of the family when
one belonging to it had been killed. The evils of this
method of punishing crime are very evident. All the
heat of personal affection for the man put to death, the
keen desire to maintain the honour of family or clan,
and the bitter hatred of the tribe to which the
homicide belonged, made the pursuit of the criminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
swift and the stroke fierce and unrelenting. A goël
put on a false track might easily strike to the ground
an innocent person; and he would feel himself bound
to incur all risks in avenging his kinsman. Often
whole tribes of Arabs are involved in the blood feud
beginning in a single stroke, and wherever the custom
prevails there is the gravest danger of wide and
sanguinary strife. The enactments of our passage are
intended to counteract in part these abuses and dangers.</p>

<p>We may wonder that the Hebrew law, enlightened
on many points, did not wholly abolish the practice of
blood revenge. Justice is not the private affair of any
man, even the nearest kinsman of one who has been
injured. We have learned that the administration of
law, especially in cases of murder or supposed murder,
is best taken out of the hands of a private avenger,
whose aim is to strike as soon and as effectually as
possible. It remains of course for those whose friend
has died by violence to institute inquiries and do their
utmost to bring the criminal to justice. But even when
a man's guilt seems clear his trial is before an impartial
judge by whom all relevant facts are elicited. In
Hebrew law there was no complete provision for such
an administration of justice. The ancient custom could
not be easily set aside, for one thing; the passionate
oriental nature would cling to it. And for another,
there was no organisation for repressing disorder and
dealing with crime. A certain risk had to be run, in
order that the sanctity of human life might be clearly
kept before a people too ready to strike as well as to
curse. But if the man-slayer was able to reach a city
of refuge he had his trial. The old custom was
checked by the right of the fugitive to claim sanctuary
and to have his case investigated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the sanctuary cities, there may also have been
some imperfect custom which anticipated them. In
Egypt there certainly was; and the Canaanites, who
had learned not a little from Egypt, may have had
sacred places that afforded protection to the fugitive.
But the Mosaic law prevented abuse of the means of
evading justice. He who had killed another was a
criminal before God. The blood of the brother he had
slain defiled the land and cried to Heaven. No sanctuary
must protect a man who had with homicidal
purpose struck another. There was to be neither
priestly protection, nor sanctuary, nor ransom for him.
The Divine principle of justice took up the cause.</p>

<p>In vv. 16 ff. there are examples of cases which are
adjudged to be murder. To smite one with an instrument
of iron, or with a stone grasped in the hand
presumably large enough to kill, or with a weapon of
wood, a heavy club or bar, is adjudged to be deliberate
homicide. Then if hatred can be proved, and one
known to have cherished enmity towards another is
shown to have thrust him down, or hurled at him,
lying in wait, or to have smitten him with the hand,
such a one is to be allowed no sanctuary. On the
other hand, the cases of inadvertent homicide are defined:
"if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or
hurled upon him anything without lying in wait, or
with any stone, whereby a man may die, seeing him
not." These, of course, are simply instances, not
exhaustive categories.</p>

<p>It is not here stated, but in Josh. xx. 4 the statute
runs that the man-slayer who fled to a sanctuary city
was to state his cause before the elders, no doubt at
the gate. Their preliminary decision had to be given
in his favour before he could be admitted. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
real trial was by the "congregation," Numb. xxxv. 24,
some assembly representing the tribe within whose
territory the crime has been committed, or more likely
a gathering of headmen of the whole nation. Further,
at ver. 30 it is enacted that the charge of the avenger
of blood against any one must be substantiated by two
witnesses at least. These provisions form the basis of
a sound judicial method. The rights of refuge and
of revenge stand opposed to each other, and between
the two a large and authoritative court gives judgment.
It will be observed, moreover, that the judiciary was
not ecclesiastical. Where power was to be exercised
in the name of God, the priests were not to wield it,
but the people. The form of government is far nearer
a democracy than a hierocracy.</p>

<p>A singular point in the law is the term during which
the unwitting man-slayer who had been acquitted by the
court of justice must remain in sanctuary. He is in
danger of being put to death by the avenger of blood
until the acting high priest dies. Till that event he
must keep within the border of his city of refuge.
And here the idea seems to be that the official memory
of the crime which had ceremonially defiled the
land rested with the high priest. He was supposed
to keep in mind, on God's behalf, the bloodshed which
even though unintentional was still polluting. His
death accordingly obliterated the recollection that kept
the man-slayer under peril of the goël's revenge. The
high priest had no power to acquit or condemn a
criminal, nor to enforce against him the punishment
of his fault. But he was the guardian of the sacredness
of the land in the midst of which Jehovah
dwelt.</p>

<p>With regard to the symbolical meaning of the cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
of refuge, it is needful to exercise great care at every
point. The man-slayer, for instance, fleeing from the
avenger of blood, is not a type of the sinner fleeing
for his life from the justice of God. If guilty of
murder, a man could find no safety even in the city
of refuge. It was only if he was not guilty of premeditated
crime that he found sanctuary. The refuge
cities, however, represented Divine justice as in contrast
to the justice or rather the vengeance of man&mdash;that
Divine justice which Christ came to reveal, giving
Himself for us upon the cross. Human righteousness
errs sometimes by excess, sometimes by defect.
Certain offences it would never condemn, others it
would passionately and remorselessly punish. The
sanctuary cities show a higher idea of justice. But all
men are guilty before God. And there is mercy with
Him not only for the unwitting transgressor, but for
the man who has to confess deliberate sin, the forfeiture
of his life to Divine law.</p>

<p>The singular opinion has been expressed that the
death of the high priest was expiatory. This is said
to be "unmistakably evident" from the addition of the
clause, "who has been anointed with the holy oil"
(ver. 25). The argument is that as the high priest's
life and work "acquired a representative signification
through this anointing with the Holy Ghost, his death
might also be regarded as a death for the sins of the
people by virtue of the Holy Ghost imparted to him,
through which the unintentional man-slayer received
the benefits of the propitiation for his sins before God,
so that he could return cleansed to his native town
without further exposure to the vengeance of the
avenger of blood." And thus, it is said, "The death
of the earthly high priest became a type of that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
the heavenly One, who through the eternal Spirit
offered Himself without spot to God, that we might
be redeemed from our transgressions." But although
many of the Rabbins and fathers held this view as to
the expiatory nature of the high priest's death, there
is absolutely nothing in Scripture or reason to support
it. All the expiation, moreover, which the Mosaic
law provided for was ceremonial. If the death of the
high priest was efficacious only so far as his functions
were, then there could be no atonement or appearance
of atonement for moral guilt, even that of culpable
homicide for instance. The death of the high priest
was therefore in no sense a type of the death of Christ,
the whole meaning of which lies in relation to moral,
not ceremonial, offences.</p>

<p>While it cannot be said that "light is thrown by the
provisions regarding cities of refuge on the atonement of
Christ"&mdash;for that would be the morning star shedding
light on the sun&mdash;still there are some points of illustration;
and one of these may be noted. As the protection
of the sanctuary city extended only to the boundaries
or precincts belonging to it, so the defence the sinner
has in Christ can be enjoyed only so far as life is
brought within the range of the influence and commands
of Christ. He who would be safe must be a Christian.
It is not mere profession of faith&mdash;"Lord, Lord, have we
not prophesied in Thy name?"&mdash;but hearty obedience
to the laws of duty coming from Christ that gives
safety. "Who shall lay any thing to the charge of
God's elect?"&mdash;and the elect are those who yield the
fruit of the Spirit, who are lovers of God and their
fellow-men, who show their faith by their works. It
is a misrepresentation of the whole teaching of Scripture
to declare that salvation can be had, apart from life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
practice, in some mythical relation with Christ which is
hardly even to be stated in words.</p>


<p>3. <span class="smcap">Tribal Inheritance.</span> Already we have heard the
appeal of the daughters of Zelophehad to be allowed
an inheritance as representing their father. Now a
question which has arisen regarding them must be
solved. The five women have not cared to undertake
the work of the upland farm allotted to them, somewhere
about the head waters of the Yarmuk. They
have, in fact, as heiresses been somewhat in request
among the young men of different tribes; and they are
almost on the point of giving their hands to husbands of
their choice. But the chiefs of the family of Manasseh
to which they belong find a danger here. The young
women may perhaps choose men of Gad, or men of
Judah. Then their land, which is part of the land of
Manasseh, will go over to the tribes of the husbands.
There will be a few acres of Judah or of Gad in the
north of Manasseh's land. And if other young women
throughout the tribes, who happen to be heiresses,
marry according to their own liking, by-and-by the
tribe territories will be all confused. Is this to be
allowed? If not, how is the evil to be prevented?</p>

<p>The national centre and general unity of Israel could
not in the early period be expected to suffice. Without
tribal coherence and a sense of corporate life in each
family the Israelites would be lost among the people
of the land. Especially would this tend to take place
on the eastern side of Jordan and in the far north.
Now the clan unity went with the land. It was as
those dwelling in a certain district the descendants of
one progenitor realised their brotherhood. Hence there
was good reason for the appeal of the Manassites and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
the legislation that followed. Women who succeeded
to land were to marry within the families of their
fathers. Men were apparently not forbidden to marry
women of another tribe if they were not heiresses. But
the possession of land by women carried with it a
responsibility and deprived them of a certain part of
freedom. Every daughter who had an inheritance was
to be wife to one of her near kin; so should no
inheritance remove from one family to another; the
tribes should cleave every one to his own inheritance.</p>

<p>The exigencies of the early settlement appear to
have required this law; and it was maintained as far
as possible, so that he who lived in a certain region
might know himself not only a Reubenite or a Benjamite
as the case might be, but a son of Hanoch of the
Reubenites, or a son of Ard among the Benjamites.
But we may doubt whether the unity of the nation
was not delayed by the means used to keep the land
for each tribe and each tribe on its own land. The
arrangement was perhaps inevitable; yet it certainly
belonged to a primitive social order. The homogeneity
of the people would have been helped and the tribes
held more closely together by interchange of land. In
every law made at an early stage of a people's
development there is involved something unsuitable to
after periods. And perhaps one error made by the
Israelites was to cling too long and too closely to tribal
descent and make too much of genealogy. The enactment
regarding the marriage of heiresses within their
own families was an old one, bearing the authority of
Moses. There came a time when it should have been
revoked and everything done that was possible to weld
the tribes together. But the old customs held; and
what was the result? The tribes east of Jordan, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
well as Dan and Asher, were well-nigh lost to the
Confederacy at an early date. Subsequently a division
began between the northern and southern peoples. We
cannot doubt that partly for want of family alliances
between Judah and Ephraim, and subordination of
tribal to national sentiment, there came the separation
into two kingdoms.</p>

<p>For the tribe idea and the other of making inheritance
of land a governing matter, the Israelites would seem
to have paid dearly. And there is danger still in the
attempt to make a nation cohere on any mere territorial
basis. It is the spirit, the fidelity to a common purpose,
and the pervasive enthusiasm that give real unity. If
these are wanting, or if the general aim is low and
material, the security of families in the soil may be
exceedingly mischievous. At the same time the old
feeling is proved to have a deep root in fact. Territorial
solidarity is indispensable to a nation; and the exclusion
of a people from large portions of its land is an
evil intolerable. Christianity has not done its work
where the Church, the teacher of righteousness, is unconcerned
for this great matter. How can religion
flourish where brotherhood fails? And how can
brotherhood survive in a nation when the right of
occupying the soil is practically denied? First among
the economic questions which claim Christian settlement
is that of land tenure, land right. Christianity
carries forward the principles of the Mosaic law into
higher ranges, where justice is not less, but more&mdash;where
brotherhood has a nobler purpose, a finer motive.</p>
